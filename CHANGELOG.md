# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.7.2] — 2026-05-07

### Fixed
- **`GET /api/config` (and the SPA's "Downloaded Groups" sidebar) repaired after the v2.7.0 SQLite migration archived `data/config.json`.** 24 endpoints in `server.js` were still reading config via `fs.readFile(CONFIG_PATH)` and ENOENT'd the moment the migration renamed the file to `config.json.migrated`. Replaced every stale read with `loadConfig()` (kv-backed since 2.7.0, self-heals on divergence). Queue, Settings, and Backfill panels were silently degrading on the same path; all are restored.
- **`GET /api/ai/perceptual-dedup/groups` no longer returns 500 with "Do not know how to serialize a BigInt"** — the BigInt `phash` field is stripped from response rows. The field was unused by the UI; the in-memory grouper still uses it internally.
- **Front-end API client aborts requests after 60 s** (`AbortController`) instead of hanging indefinitely when the backend stalls. Errors carry `timedOut === true` so callers can show a specific toast.

### Tests
- `tests/api-resilience.test.js` (5) — Express error-middleware shape, `api.js` fetch-timeout abort path, `findPhashGroups` response is JSON-safe.

## [2.7.1] — 2026-05-06

### Changed — NSFW review tool redesign
- Grid view (3 / 4 / 6 cols by breakpoint) replaces the one-row-per-file list; click a tile to open the full media viewer with score / tier overlay.
- Lightbox shortcuts: `w` whitelist (or restore) · `r` re-classify · `d` delete. Actions auto-advance so the operator never has to click "next".
- Page shortcuts (modal closed): `[` / `]` page · `1`-`5` pick tier · `0` clear tier.
- Tier + page + show-whitelisted live in `#/maintenance/nsfw?tier=...&page=...&whitelisted=...` so refresh / back-button restore filter context. Bare URL defaults to the `uncertain` tier.
- "Show whitelisted" toggle + per-row Restore + bulk "Restore all" recover from accidental whitelists. `/v2/unwhitelist` now accepts the same `{tier|...}` body shape as the other bulk endpoints.
- Histogram: `h-32`, tier-band shading behind bars, vertical threshold marker (`τ` label), x-axis ticks at 0 / 25 / 50 / 75 / 100%.
- Settings card collapses into a native `<details>` / `<summary>` so the review surface lives above the fold.

### Performance
- `getNsfwHistogram` is one `GROUP BY bin` SQL pass (was: load every score into Node and bin in JS).
- `getNsfwTierCounts` is one `CASE-SUM` (was: 5 separate `COUNT(*)`).
- `getNsfwIdsByTier` is one `SELECT id` (was: paginated walker, 75+ queries on a 15k-row tier). `scoreMin` / `scoreMax` filters pushed into SQL.
- New partial index `idx_nsfw_tier (file_type, nsfw_whitelist, nsfw_score) WHERE nsfw_score IS NOT NULL` covers the hot path for tier counts, list pagination, and bulk-id resolution.
- Page init parallelises 5 independent fetches via `Promise.all`.

### Fixed — NSFW review
- Cache-clear confirm dialog now styles the destructive button correctly (`confirmDanger` was an unrecognized field; uses the documented `danger` flag).
- Bulk-action buttons recover automatically when a `nsfw_bulk_done` event drops in flight: 60 s watchdog re-polls `/v2/bulk/status`, and `ws.on('open')` reconciles on reconnect.
- `nsfw_bulk_progress` payload's `processed` / `total` now drives a live "Processing N / M…" hint instead of being discarded.
- Duplicate "Keep" per-row button removed (was a wrapper around `/v2/reclassify`).

### Fixed — HTTP resilience (no more 502 bursts on transient errors)
- HTTP server drains in-flight requests on uncaught exceptions instead of calling `process.exit(1)` immediately. Concurrent clients hitting the box during the watchdog restart window used to all see `502 Bad Gateway`; the 5-second drain lets them complete (or get a clean 5xx) first.
- Express error middleware converts a thrown route handler or `next(err)` call into a JSON 500 instead of leaving the response open until the reverse proxy times out (which surfaces as 502 to the client).
- Node socket timeouts aligned with reverse-proxy windows — `keepAliveTimeout` 65 s, `headersTimeout` 70 s, `requestTimeout` 120 s. The Node default of 5 s let nginx / Cloudflare reuse a keep-alive socket the origin had already closed, producing spurious 502s.

### Tests
- `tests/db-nsfw.test.js` (11) — tier-counts shape, histogram density + bin clamp, ids resolver edge cases, `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN` index selection.

## [2.7.0] — 2026-05-06

### Changed — Runtime state moves into SQLite
- **`data/config.json` → `kv['config']` row** in `data/db.sqlite`. `loadConfig()` / `saveConfig()` keep their existing signatures; only the storage backend changes. Atomic writes ride on SQLite transactions instead of tmp+rename.
- **`data/web-sessions.json` → `web_sessions` table.** Indexed `expires_at` makes the GC sweep an O(log n) delete instead of a whole-file rewrite on every login/logout.
- **`data/disk_usage.json` → `kv['disk_usage']` row.** Same 10-second debounce window, no more JSON file on disk.
- **`fs.watch` → in-process `EventEmitter`.** `saveConfig()` emits `change` synchronously after the row commits; `monitor.js` subscribes via `watchConfig()` and reloads without a filesystem signal. Removes the 100 ms debounce and dodges the cross-platform inconsistency of `fs.watch`.

### Added
- Generic kv accessors in `src/core/db.js`: `kvGet`, `kvSet`, `kvDelete`, `kvList`.
- Session accessors: `insertSession`, `findSession`, `deleteSession`, `deleteAllSessions`, `deleteSessionsByRole`, `deleteExpiredSessions`, `listSessions`.
- `src/core/state-migration.js` — one-shot importer that runs inside `getDb()` on first boot. Reads any leftover `config.json` / `disk_usage.json` / `web-sessions.json`, writes them into the new tables, then renames the sources to `<file>.migrated` as a reversible backup. Idempotent on re-run.

### Migration
Existing installs upgrade in place — first boot moves your settings, sessions, and disk-usage cache into `data/db.sqlite` and renames the JSON files to `*.migrated`. To roll back, stop the dashboard, rename the `.migrated` files back to `.json`, and downgrade.

### Tests
- `tests/kv.test.js` (8) — round-trip, UPSERT, updated_at, delete, list, corrupt-row tolerance.
- `tests/web-sessions.test.js` (8) — insert / find / role check / by-role / GC / self-clean of expired tokens.
- `tests/state-migration.test.js` (5) — full fixture: 3 JSON files in, 3 rows out + `.migrated` renames + expired-token drop.
- `tests/config-manager.test.js` (7) — kv-backed seed, deep-merge, self-heal write-back, addGroup upsert, EventEmitter delivery + unsubscribe.

## [2.6.17] — 2026-05-06

### Added
- **Queue page batch actions + Retry All.** The Queue only had per-row controls and three "all queued" shortcuts (pause/resume/cancel); long failure runs after a network hiccup or session re-auth meant clicking Retry on every failed row, and there was no way to act on a chosen subset. This release adds: per-row checkboxes + a header tri-state checkbox; click toggles, Shift+click does range, Ctrl/Cmd+click toggles a single row, Ctrl/Cmd+A selects all visible, Esc clears; a floating action bar that appears at the bottom when ≥1 row is selected and mirrors the per-row vocabulary (Pause / Resume / Retry / Dismiss / Cancel) — the bar respects the queue page's visibility so it doesn't leak across navigation; and a new "Retry All" toolbar button that's disabled when there are no failed rows. Backed by two new endpoints — `POST /api/queue/retry-all` walks every cached failed job, and `POST /api/queue/batch` accepts `{ keys, action }` so one user gesture is one round trip regardless of selection size. Selection survives WS churn (jobs are pinned by key, not row ref); rows that disappear via cancel/dismiss are pruned out of the selection automatically.

### Internal
- SW bumped `v276` → `v277`.

## [2.6.16] — 2026-05-06

### Fixed
- **Docker image shipped ffmpeg with VA-API compiled in but no userland drivers**, so `-hwaccel vaapi` silently fell back to CPU decode inside the container even when the host passed `/dev/dri` through. The Settings → Advanced → Thumbnails dropdown listed `vaapi` as available (because `ffmpeg -hwaccels` advertises it from compile-time support, regardless of runtime), but selecting it produced no actual acceleration. Adds `intel-media-va-driver` (iHD, Gen8+ + Quick Sync runtime), `i965-va-driver` (Gen4-Gen7), and `vainfo` (operators can now `docker exec <ctr> vainfo` to confirm the driver loaded inside the container without baking their own debug image). All three packages live in Debian bookworm `main` so no non-free repo enablement is required. AMD users go through Mesa's `radeonsi` (`mesa-va-drivers`) — left out to keep the image lean; can be added in a follow-up if reported.

### Internal
- SW bumped `v275` → `v276`.

## [2.6.15] — 2026-05-06

### Fixed
- **Auto-download silently routed every job through the default Telegram client**, even when the chat was only reachable via a 2nd/3rd account. Monitor's poll/handler paths and history's backfill now pin the working client into each job, and `DownloadManager` prefers `job.client` over its constructor-injected default for both `downloadMedia` and the `FILE_REFERENCE_EXPIRED` refresh path. Symptoms: groups visible only to a non-default account would surface in the Monitor stats but their files never landed on disk (or pulled from the wrong session).
- **`/api/download/url` mutated `downloader.client` per request** as a hack to switch sessions for a paste-link job — a latent race where any concurrent download suddenly tried to fetch bytes through the URL-resolver's session. Replaced with a per-job `client` field. Stories download + retry-from-Queue retain the same client too, so a job that originally ran on account #2 doesn't fall back to the default on retry.

### Added
- **Queue page now shows which Telegram account pulled each job**, as a small chip next to the filename. New `AccountManager.getIdForClient()` reverse-lookup powers the attribution; snapshot + WS payloads (`download_start`, `download_progress`, `download_complete`, `download_error`) carry `accountId` + `accountName`. Legacy rows without account info skip the chip cleanly. Tooltip i18n keys: `queue.account.tooltip` (en + th).

### Internal
- SW bumped `v274` → `v275`.

## [2.6.14] — 2026-05-06

### Internal
- **Toolchain swap: Biome 2 + Lefthook replaces eslint, prettier, husky, and lint-staged.** Single binary now does lint + format + autofix; pre-commit hook runs `biome check --write` only on staged files (via `{staged_files}` in `lefthook.yml`). Lint config tuned to match the prior eslint.config.js intent (project predates a linter — focus on real bugs, not style; rules that would force source-code rewrites are off and can be enabled in follow-up PRs). 128 files reformatted on first pass — pure whitespace + quote churn from switching formatters; no behavior changes. README, CONTRIBUTING, and AUDIT.md updated to reflect the new toolchain. Five CodeQL alerts on the merge ref were dismissed (`won't fix`) because they were re-detections of pre-existing patterns at line numbers that shifted under reformat — the underlying logic was untouched. (PR #28)
- Removed `apps/` and `packages/` directories — leftover artifacts (~10 MB) from a never-shipped monorepo experiment, unrelated to the runtime.
- README's `npm run web` reference was a long-standing dead link (no such script). Replaced with `npm start` (dashboard) and `npm run menu` (interactive CLI menu).
- SW bumped `v273` → `v274`.

## [2.6.13] — 2026-05-06

### Fixed
- **Manage Groups only showed chats from one account** when 2+ Telegram accounts were linked. `/api/dialogs` was calling `getDialogs()` on the AccountManager's *default* client only, so any chat exclusive to a second/third account silently disappeared from the picker (the sidebar's `/api/groups` view was already correct because it goes through `getDialogsNameCache()`, which fans out across all clients). The endpoint now fans out across every connected client in parallel, dedupes by chat id (first sighting wins; active beats archived), and also returns an `accounts: [{id, name, phone, username}]` directory + `accountIds: []` per dialog so the SPA can attribute each chat back to the account(s) it lives in.
- **Manage Groups now shows account chips** under each chat title (only when 2+ accounts are linked — single-account installs see no change). Each account gets a stable color hashed from its id so the same chip is recognisable across rows + reloads. The chip label prefers `@username`, falls back to phone, then display name. Hovering shows a richer title (name · phone · @username). A chat shared by both accounts gets two chips. Added on `.chat-row .row-account-chips` + `.chat-row .account-chip` with dark/light theme variants.
- **i18n: 8 referenced keys were never added to the locale files** so they showed their inline fallback text in both English and Thai instead of the translation: `maintenance.dedup.set_header_v2`, `maintenance.dedup.set_reclaim`, `maintenance.dedup.loading_remaining`, `maintenance.dedup.stat.{sets,copies,files,reclaim}`, and `maintenance.ai.toggle.failed`. Added all 8 to `en.json` + `th.json` (en/th now have full key parity at 1335 each).
- **`tests/shortcut-overrides.test.js` was failing 5/6 in `vitest run`** because the polyfill installed at module top-level only ran when `globalThis.localStorage` was strictly `undefined`; some other test in the suite leaked a stub Storage object (no `setItem`) onto the global, so the polyfill never installed and `localStorage.setItem(...)` from inside test bodies threw. Switched to always-assigning the polyfill and re-installing in `beforeEach` so each test sees a fresh writable store regardless of suite ordering.

### Internal
- SW bumped `v272` → `v273`.

## [2.6.12] — 2026-05-06

### Fixed
- **Maintenance tab strip was hidden on the Video page** added in v2.6.10. The CSS `display: flex` rule that toggles the `#maintenance-tabs` strip on per-feature pages enumerates each page slug explicitly (`body[data-page="maintenance-thumbs"] #maintenance-tabs, …`); `maintenance-video` was missing from that list, so navigating into `/#/maintenance/video` hid the strip + back link entirely. Adds the missing selector. (PR #25)

### Internal
- SW bumped `v271` → `v272`.

## [2.6.11] — 2026-05-06

### Fixed
- **Mobile gallery video viewer flashing "Error 4: playback failed"** on roughly a quarter of opens, with the Retry button always succeeding. Cause: mobile Safari (and occasionally Chrome on Android) fires a spurious `MEDIA_ERR_SRC_NOT_SUPPORTED` event right after the first `src=` assignment when an in-flight HTTP fetch from a previous unload is still aborting. The user-visible Retry was doing the same thing the new auto-retry does — re-assign the same URL and call `load()` — so the file itself was never broken. Fix: `_showError()` silently retries once when the error code is 4 on a first attempt (bounded via `_errorRetries`, reset every `.load()`), and `unload()` now nulls out `video.onerror` *before* `removeAttribute('src') + load()` so the abort no longer fires a stray event into a stale handler. Genuine unsupported-codec failures still surface the overlay after the single retry. (PR #23)

### Internal
- SW bumped `v270` → `v271`.

## [2.6.10] — 2026-05-06

### Added
- **Maintenance → Optimise videos for streaming** (`#/maintenance/video`). MP4 / M4V / MOV / 3GP files whose `moov` index atom lives at the end of the file (the encoder default for many sources, including the clips this app downloads from Telegram) break the HTML5 `<video>` element in subtle ways: the player has to fetch every byte of `mdat` before it can paint a frame, decode audio, or honour a seek — so the gallery viewer looked like the video had no audio and the seek bar was dead. The new sweep walks every catalogued video, peeks the first 64 bytes to find the second atom, and rewrites any file whose `moov` is not at the head with `ffmpeg -movflags +faststart -c copy -map 0`. Stream-copy means no re-encode and no quality loss; the operation is I/O bound and finishes in seconds per file. Atomic publish via `<file>.faststart.tmp` + rename, sanity-checked tmp size (within 5–110 % of source) so a half-written file never overwrites the original. Concurrency capped at 2 by default (env `FASTSTART_CONCURRENCY`); WS progress + done events drive a determinate progress bar; `/api/maintenance/faststart/status` recovers in-flight state on tab reopen. The dashboard surfaces total / optimised / pending / skipped counts. Scan is admin-only and gated by `_faststartRunning` single-flight.
- **Auto-faststart on every new download.** The downloader fires `optimizeDownloadInBackground(id)` after the post-insert thumb pre-generation, so MP4s land in faststart-optimised form for the gallery's first view. No-op for non-video / non-MP4 / already-optimised rows. Same fire-and-forget shape as the thumb pre-gen — failures are warned once to console and silently retried by the maintenance sweep next time.

### Migration
Existing libraries: open `Maintenance → Optimise videos for streaming` once, click `Optimise all`, wait. The sweep runs in the background; you can leave the page or close the tab. New downloads after the upgrade are fixed inline.

### Internal
- SW bumped `v269` → `v270`.

## [2.6.9] — 2026-05-06

### Fixed
- **Video thumbnails were missing on Debian-based Docker hosts** (every `/api/thumbs/<id>` for a video row returned `404 "No thumb"` while images worked fine, and `Maintenance → Build all` reported `built=0` with `errored=0` because failures were silently coerced to "skipped"). Root cause: `_generateVideoThumb` writes a `<sha>.webp.tmp` file for atomic-rename-on-success, but the system `/usr/bin/ffmpeg` from `apt-get install ffmpeg` (Debian 12 / bookworm) refuses to infer the output muxer from a `.tmp` extension and exits non-zero with `Unable to find a suitable output format`. The bundled `@ffmpeg-installer/ffmpeg` build used on macOS / Windows happens to fall back to the codec hint, which is why localhost worked while production did not. Fix: pass `-f webp` explicitly in the single-pass libwebp branch so the muxer is named regardless of the destination filename. The JPEG → sharp fallback path was not affected (its tmp file already ends in `.jpg`).

### Internal
- SW bumped `v268` → `v269`.

## [2.6.8] — 2026-05-05

### Fixed
- **Gallery tile thumbnails were stuck at `opacity: 0`** so every photo and video tile rendered as a black box even though the WebP thumb file was generated, the HTTP response was 200, and the `<img>` element loaded successfully. CSS keeps `.media-item img` invisible until a `.loaded` class is added — that class used to be wired up by the lazy-load IntersectionObserver, but the tile template had moved to native `loading="lazy"` and no longer carried `data-src`, so the observer never fired. The tile now adds `.loaded` from inline `onload` / `onerror` handlers, which works for both successful loads and 404 fallbacks. (PR #19)

### Changed
- **Node baseline raised to 22 LTS** (was `>=20.0.0`). Node 20 reaches EOL April 2026; 22 has been LTS since October 2024. The Docker runtime image moves to `node:24.15.0-bookworm-slim` (current Active LTS, supported through April 2027). `src/index.js`'s doctor check is updated to match. (PR #20)
- **CI matrix** now tests against Node `22` and `24` instead of `20` and `22`. (PR #20)
- **Production deps bumped** by dependabot's grouped PR: `@aws-sdk/client-s3` 3.1041.0 → 3.1042.0, `@aws-sdk/lib-storage` 3.1041.0 → 3.1042.0, `better-sqlite3` 12.6.2 → 12.9.0, `ws` 8.19.0 → 8.20.0. (PR #21)
- **GitHub Actions bumped** by dependabot's grouped PR: `actions/checkout` v4 → v6, `actions/setup-node` v4 → v6, `github/codeql-action` v3 → v4, `docker/setup-buildx-action` v3 → v4, `docker/build-push-action` v6 → v7, `docker/login-action` v3 → v4, `docker/metadata-action` v5 → v6 (8 actions total). `release-drafter/release-drafter` is intentionally pinned at v6 — v7 currently fails on `pull_request` triggers with `Validation Failed: target_commitish` because it tries to update the in-progress draft against `refs/pull/<n>/merge`, which the GitHub Releases API rejects. Revisit once upstream cuts a v7 patch. (PR #16)

### CI
- **Docker smoke test fixed** — was flaking on every PR with `FAIL: no node process running as node user`. The healthcheck-then-`ps` approach grepped column 2 (`COMMAND`, where `comm` is truncated) with a fragile `awk` pattern that silently failed even when `ps -ef` could see the node process. Switched to grepping column 1 (`UNAME`) of `ps -ef` directly, wrapped in a 10× / 1 s retry loop purely for boot timing. The retry never had to fire on the verifying run; the column choice was the actual bug. (PR #20)

### Internal
- SW bumped `v267` → `v268`.

## [2.6.7] — 2026-05-05

### Fixed
- **Default AI face + tag models swapped** to publicly-accessible alternatives. `Xenova/yolov5n-face` and `Xenova/mobilenet_v2` are gated/restricted on HuggingFace (return 401 even with a valid `Read` token, while `Xenova/clip-vit-base-patch32` and other Xenova models work fine). New defaults:
    - faces: `Xenova/yolos-tiny` (general detector, "person" class drives the clustering pipeline; ~31 MB)
    - tags: `Xenova/vit-base-patch16-224` (ImageNet-1k head, drop-in replacement for the tag cloud)

### Migration
Existing configs still pointing at `Xenova/yolov5n-face` / `Xenova/mobilenet_v2` need to be flipped manually: open `/maintenance/ai` → Models panel → paste the new id into the Apply field, click Apply, then preload.

### Internal
- SW bumped `v266` → `v267`.

## [2.6.6] — 2026-05-05

### Fixed
- **AI master Start/Stop toggle now lives in static HTML** at the top of `/maintenance/ai`. Was rendered dynamically inside the Capabilities grid, which meant a stale-cache JS bundle (or any render-path failure) hid it entirely — operators saw "Start scan" buttons but no way to actually start the subsystem. Static markup keeps the control visible regardless of what the grid does. State pill (`On` / `Off`) syncs live with the toggle.

### Internal
- SW bumped `v265` → `v266`.

## [2.6.5] — 2026-05-05

### Added
- **HuggingFace token "Test" button** on `/maintenance/ai`. Pings `huggingface.co/api/whoami-v2` with the typed (or saved) token. Shows green "signed in as <name>" on success, red "Token rejected by HuggingFace" on 401 — so the operator knows the token works before kicking off a model preload.
- **Show/hide eye toggle** on the token field so operators can verify they pasted the right value without re-typing.
- **"Get a token →" link + collapsible How-to** (sign in → Settings → Access Tokens → Read role → paste). Removes the "where do I find this?" friction.

### Internal
- New endpoint `POST /api/ai/hf/test { token? }` → `{ ok, status, name?, message? }`. Falls back to the saved `advanced.ai.hfToken` when the body's `token` field is empty so a save-then-test flow works too. 5-second timeout, 401/network errors surface verbatim.
- SW bumped `v264` → `v265`.

## [2.6.4] — 2026-05-05

### Fixed
- **Share v2 URLs returning "Invalid share link"** — route handler still expected the legacy `?exp=&sig=` shape; URL builder generates `?s=<sig>` (v2). Handler now accepts both, looks up the row first, and verifies the sig against the stored `expires_at`. Filename slug routes (`/share/<id>/<filename>?s=…`) also work.
- **Stale CSS in production** — `<link href="/css/main.css?v=2.6.0">` was hard-coded. Newer releases shipped CSS classes (`.share-maint-toolbar`, `.log-src-chip`, `.ai-hero`) that the SW kept serving from the v2.6.0 cache. The cache-bust rewriter now covers `/css/` paths too, and the `<link>` no longer carries a stale literal version.

### Added
- **HuggingFace access token field** on `/maintenance/ai`. Set it from the web instead of needing `HF_TOKEN` in env. Stored in `config.advanced.ai.hfToken`; both NSFW and AI capability loaders read it.

### Internal
- SW bumped `v263` → `v264`.

## [2.6.3] — 2026-05-05

### Fixed
- **pHash write crash** — "The bound string, buffer, or bigint is too big". `setPhash` now bit-casts the unsigned 64-bit hash into the signed 64-bit range SQLite can store, and `listAllPhashes` reads in `safeIntegers(true)` mode so values outside JS Number's 2^53 envelope round-trip cleanly. Hamming distance still works at the bit level (the helper masks back to 64 bits before XOR).
- **AI model loads behind 401 / rate limits** — every transformers.js fetch now sends an `Authorization: Bearer …` header when `HF_TOKEN` (or `HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN` / `HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN`) is set in env. Lets operators pull gated repos + dodge anonymous rate-limit walls.
- **Docker smoke test exit 127** — bookworm-slim runtime image was missing `procps`, so the CI smoke test's `docker exec smoke ps -o user=,comm=` returned 127. `procps` is now installed in the runtime stage (~500 KB).

### Internal
- SW bumped `v262` → `v263`.

## [2.6.2] — 2026-05-05

### Fixed
- **NSFW default model swapped** to `AdamCodd/vit-base-nsfw-detector`. The previous default `Falconsai/nsfw_image_detection` is PyTorch-only — its `onnx/` directory 404s, so transformers.js can't load any of the dtype variants (q8/fp16/fp32/q4 all fail). AdamCodd ships full ONNX coverage and is the de-facto transformers.js NSFW classifier.
- Operators on a fresh install no longer hit "Could not locate file" preload errors out of the box.

### Internal
- SW bumped `v261` → `v262`.

## [2.6.1] — 2026-05-05

### Fixed
- NSFW model load — default `dtype: 'q8'` (quantized) + auto-fallback through fp16/fp32/q4 when the chosen variant isn't on the HF CDN.
- Queue rows missed the duplicate flag — `runtime._serializeJob` now propagates `deduped`; rows render a "Duplicate" tag + a Duplicate filter chip.
- `confirmSheet` accepts both `{message,confirmLabel,danger}` and `{body,confirmText,destructive}` (half the call sites silently dropped options before).
- Service Worker `/js/` strategy flipped to network-first so stale `.js` can't outlive a deploy. Bumped `v260` → `v261`.
- Trimmed verbose Maintenance-card help text.

### Added
- NSFW: model-id input + precision picker + Preload-now button + Preload-on-start toggle + Wipe cached weights. Endpoints: `POST /api/maintenance/nsfw/preload`, `GET /api/maintenance/nsfw/model-status`, `DELETE /api/maintenance/nsfw/cache`.
- AI master switch + per-capability toggles on `/maintenance/ai`.
- Settings chip-nav — 10 chips per top-level card with IntersectionObserver-driven active state.
- Active share links modal — stats grid + sticky toolbar + filter chips + Cleanup-expired bulk action + polished row design (state pill, Open/Copy/Revoke 28×28).
- Logs filter chips — branded toggle pills with per-source coloured dot + live count badge + All/None.
- Duplicates page — bulk "Keep oldest / Keep newest / Clear" toolbar.
- Install-update button disables + relabels to "Up to date" when on the latest release.
- Verify-files done event also lands in the bell notification list.

### Changed
- Per-tool settings moved to per-tool maintenance pages (no duplicate in Settings → Advanced).
- Backfill page patches active rows in place on WS progress (was full innerHTML rewrite per tick).
- AI hero search drops purple accent — uses Telegram blue, label-above-chip layout, disabled mic removed.
- Thumb-miss warning: 15-min window + 200-miss floor + 30-min cooldown + opt-out toggle (~2/h instead of ~60/h).
- `notify-clear-btn` icon-only.

### Internal
- New config keys: `advanced.nsfw.dtype`, `advanced.nsfw.preload`, `advanced.thumbs.warnMisses` (allow-list-validated).
- New WS events: `nsfw_model_downloading`, `ai_model_progress`.
- `setupAutoSave` binds at `<body>` so per-tool settings cards autosave through the same pipeline.

## [2.6.0] — 2026-05-04

### Added — Single-row Maintenance hub
- **Sidebar collapsed from 6 maintenance entries to 1.** A new `#/maintenance` hub page renders every tool as a card grid (1 / 2 / 3 columns by viewport) with live status pills wired to the WS progress channel. Per-feature deep links (`/maintenance/duplicates`, `/maintenance/nsfw`, etc.) still resolve directly so power users keep their muscle memory.
- New `src/web/public/js/maintenance-hub.js` (~120 LOC) — coalesced WS dispatcher + status hydration on (re-)entry.
- Mobile + desktop both benefit; the previous 5+ rows dominated the sidebar at every viewport.

### Added — Local AI search & smart organisation (opt-in)
- **Semantic search** — CLIP image+text embeddings (`Xenova/clip-vit-base-patch32`, ~90 MB, WASM). `POST /api/ai/search { query }` returns top-K rows ranked by cosine similarity.
- **Face clustering ("People")** — YOLOv5n-face detector + CLIP-on-crop embeddings + DBSCAN. Admin can rename clusters and browse photos per person.
- **Auto-tag** — ImageNet classifier (`Xenova/mobilenet_v2`, ~14 MB) writes top-K labels per photo into `image_tags`. Powers the tag cloud + #tag filter on the new page.
- **Perceptual dedup (pHash)** — DCT-based 64-bit hash, no model required. Groups near-duplicates by Hamming distance; reuses the existing dedup-delete pathway.
- New page `#/maintenance/ai` with toggles, scan progress, search, tag cloud, people grid, and near-duplicate groups. Default-OFF; every capability is gated by `config.advanced.ai.<cap>.enabled`.
- 12 endpoints under `/api/ai/*`, all admin-only and JobTracker-driven (returns 200 immediately, WS progress).
- Models lazy-loaded into `data/models/` (override with `AI_MODELS_DIR`); fresh installs pull zero AI weights.
- Optional `sqlite-vec` fast-path auto-detected at boot; in-memory cosine fallback covers libraries up to ~50k photos.
- Documentation: `docs/AI.md` (architecture, models, troubleshooting); `docs/DEPLOY.md` env-var table updated; README "Why people use it" bullet added.
- 17 new tests under `tests/ai/`: pHash determinism + Hamming distance, vector-store BLOB round-trip + cosine + top-K ordering, DBSCAN cluster isolation.

### Added — Gallery + viewer polish
- Right-click context menu on gallery tiles (Open / Download / Copy link / Share / Pin / Forward / Delete); `ContextMenu` key fires the same menu on the focused tile.
- Pin / unpin per file (star icon on every tile) + a "Pinned" filter chip in the gallery type strip + opt-in "Surface pinned at the top" library setting.
- Drag-drop a `t.me/...` URL anywhere on the dashboard → auto-queue download with a dashed-border drop overlay.
- Bulk **Download ZIP** button on the selection bar — streams a STORE-mode archive (multi-GB safe, no archive ever lives in RAM).
- Mini-player — sticky bottom-right preview that keeps a video clip playing after the viewer modal is closed; click to expand back. Opt-in via `viewer-shrink-on-close` localStorage flag.
- In-app changelog viewer — overlay sheet that fetches `/CHANGELOG.md` and renders a markdown-parsed timeline, triggered by clicking the version chip in the status bar.
- Locales: new `gallery.context.*`, `favorites.*`, `viewer.pip.*`, `viewer.selection.*`, `dragdrop.*`, `prefs.*`, `tour.*`, `changelog.viewer.*`, `groups.accent_color`/`groups.description`/`groups.rename_inline`, `storage.breakdown.*` keys in `en` + `th`.

### Added — Power-user / accessibility
- Screen Wake Lock during downloads — feature-detected via `navigator.wakeLock`; auto-acquires when a job is in flight, releases when the queue drains, re-acquires on tab visibility-change.
- System notifications on download complete + click-to-focus dashboard. New `notifyGeneric(title, body)` helper for one-shot finished events.
- Keyboard shortcut customisation — `localStorage['tgdl-shortcut-overrides']` lets users rebind every shortcut; new exports `loadShortcutOverrides`, `setShortcutOverride`, `effectiveShortcuts`, `resetShortcutOverrides` from `shortcuts.js`.
- High-contrast mode — `@media (prefers-contrast: more)` block in `main.css` plus a manual `html[data-contrast="more"]` toggle.

### Added — Server endpoints
- `POST /api/downloads/:id/pin { pinned: bool }` — toggle the `pinned` column. Broadcasts `download_pinned` over WS.
- `POST /api/downloads/bulk-zip { ids: [...] }` — streams a ZIP attachment of every requested file. Cap: ~4 GiB total + 65 535 entries (no ZIP64). Filename: `tgdl-<group>-<count>files-<ts>.zip`.
- `GET /api/downloads/all?pinned=1&pinnedFirst=1` and `GET /api/downloads/:groupId?pinned=1&pinnedFirst=1` — opt-in pinned filter / sort.
- `GET /CHANGELOG.md` — read-once Markdown serve for the in-app viewer (admin + guest), 1-hour `must-revalidate` cache.

### Added — DB
- `setDownloadPinned(id, pinned)` and `getDownloadById(id)` in `src/core/db.js`.
- `getAllDownloads` / `getDownloads` accept `{ pinnedOnly, pinnedFirst }` opts; existing callers behave identically.

### Performance
- **Hash worker pool** — new `src/core/hash-worker.js`. SHA-256 streaming on a `worker_threads` pool (default `min(8, ⌊cpus/2⌋)`, `HASH_WORKER_POOL_SIZE` overrides). Wired into `core/downloader.js` and `core/dedup.js` so multi-GB hashing no longer blocks the main event loop.
- **HTTP compression** — optional `compression` middleware enabled via `createRequire` (gracefully no-ops if the package isn't installed). Skips already-compressed media (`image/*` / `video/*` / `audio/*`). `COMPRESSION_LEVEL` env var (default 6).
- **Static asset caching** — `/icons/*` joins `/css/*` and `/js/*` in the 1-year `immutable` Cache-Control bucket when the request carries the `?v=`. `/locales/*` gets `must-revalidate` for translation freshness.
- **`<link rel="modulepreload">`** for the SPA's hot-path import graph (`app.js`, `api.js`, `ws.js`, `router.js`, `i18n.js`, `store.js`, `utils.js`).
- **Streaming bulk ZIP** — pure-JS PKZIP writer (`src/core/zip-stream.js`) with backpressure-aware piping so a 5 GB selection writes through to the response sink without buffering.

### Tests
- `tests/perf-headers.test.js` (8) — Cache-Control assertions for `/css/`, `/js/`, `/icons/`, `/api/*`, `/sw.js`, `/locales/*`, `/files/*`.
- `tests/hash-worker.test.js` (5) — known SHA-256 round-trip across the pool, in-process streamer, concurrent requests, missing-file rejection, `HASH_WORKER_DISABLE=1` fallback.
- `tests/zip-bulk.test.js` (3) — EOCD parse, STORE-mode round-trip across multiple files, `safeArchiveName` invariants.
- `tests/shortcut-overrides.test.js` (6) — defaults, override persistence, replacement, reset, malformed JSON tolerance, defensive type filtering.

### Docs
- `docs/DEPLOY.md` — env var rows for `HASH_WORKER_POOL_SIZE`, `HASH_WORKER_DISABLE`, `COMPRESSION_LEVEL`.
- `README.md` — two new bullets under "Why people use it" (gallery polish + perf passes).

## [2.5.0] — 2026-05-04

### Added — Universal background-job pattern
- **`src/core/job-tracker.js`** — single-flight orchestration primitive every long-running admin endpoint now wraps. Exposes `tryStart(runFn)` (returns `{started:true}` or 409 `ALREADY_RUNNING`), `cancel()` via AbortController, `getStatus()` snapshot, automatic WS broadcast of `<kind>_progress` + `<kind>_done`, plus `log()` integration. **Cloudflare-safe by construction**: every wrapped POST returns ≤500 ms.
- **13 endpoints converted** to fire-and-forget — previously any of these could time out behind a 100 s reverse-proxy: `files/verify`, `db/vacuum`, `db/integrity`, `restart-monitor`, `resync-dialogs`, `dedup/delete`, NSFW v2 bulk-{delete,whitelist,unwhitelist,reclassify} (shared tracker), `thumbs/rebuild`, `auto-update`, `groups/refresh-info`, `groups/refresh-photos`, `groups/:id/purge` (multi-flight per id), `purge-all`. Each gets a `/status` companion, a WS event prefix, and a frontend that hydrates state on init.
- **`src/web/public/js/job-buttons.js`** — frontend helper. `wireJobButton({ btn, statusUrl, eventPrefix, runUrl })` — one binding, six call sites in Settings. Hydrates from `/status` on mount, listens to WS, handles 409 by re-hydrating instead of erroring.
- **Multi-client coordination**. Start a `Build all thumbnails` on a phone → desktop's button immediately disables. Cancel from desktop → both clients re-enable. State lives on the server, every client is a renderer.
- **Cancel + abort threading**. Long jobs accept an `AbortSignal`; clicking Cancel stops the worker within seconds.
- 14 new tests (`tests/job-tracker.test.js` + `tests/job-tracker-multi-client.test.js`) — single-flight, 409 path, abort propagation, two virtual WS clients receive the same payload.

### Added — Backup destinations (NAS-style multi-provider mirror + snapshot)
- **`#/maintenance/backup`** — full-page admin surface for off-host backups. Cards-grid layout with per-destination Run / Pause / Test / Edit / Remove buttons + recent-jobs strip + WS-driven live state.
- **Three first-class providers**: S3-compatible (covers AWS / Cloudflare R2 / Backblaze B2 / MinIO / Wasabi from one driver via `@aws-sdk/client-s3`), local filesystem / NAS mount, SFTP (`ssh2-sftp-client`).
- **Three modes per destination**: `mirror` (every `download_complete` enqueues a job), `snapshot` (cron-scheduled tar.gz of `db.sqlite` + `config.json` + `sessions/`, retains last N copies on the remote), `manual` (only fires on `POST /run`).
- **Persistent retry queue** — DB-backed (`backup_jobs`), exponential backoff (capped 30 min), max-attempts giveup, boot-time recovery of stuck `uploading` rows.
- **Optional client-side encryption** — AES-256-GCM with a per-destination salt + PBKDF2-SHA256 (200k) key derivation. Passphrase lives in process memory only; restart re-prompts via the dashboard's Unlock action. File format: `magic 'TGDB' | version | iv | ciphertext | tag`.
- **Credentials encrypted at rest** — provider configs in `backup_destinations.config_blob` are AES-256-GCM-encrypted under a KEK derived from `config.web.shareSecret`.
- **Endpoints**: `GET/POST /api/backup/destinations`, `PUT/DELETE /:id`, `POST /:id/test|run|pause|resume|encryption|unlock`, `GET /:id/status|jobs`, `GET /api/backup/jobs/recent`, `POST /api/backup/jobs/:id/retry`, `GET /api/backup/providers`.
- **WS events**: `backup_destination_added/updated/removed`, `backup_progress`, `backup_done`, `backup_error`, `backup_queue_drained`.
- **Stub providers** for FTP / Google Drive / Dropbox — wizard pickers list them as "coming soon"; their dependencies are `optionalDependencies` so default installs stay slim.
- **`BACKUP_WORKERS_PER_DEST`** env var (default 3) caps per-destination concurrency.
- 20 new tests (encryption round-trip, credentials encrypt/decrypt with rotation, queue retry timing, local-provider full I/O); 2 S3 tests skipped without `MINIO_TEST_ENDPOINT`.

### Changed — Share-link URL format (v2.5)
- **`/share/<linkId>?exp=<sec>&sig=<43chars>`** → **`/share/<linkId>/<filename>?s=<43chars>`**. The expiry is now read from the DB row (single source of truth), the URL drops `?exp=` entirely, and a sanitised filename segment makes downloads land with a sensible name. The HMAC still binds `(linkId | exp_at_issue)`, so URLs minted before this release continue to verify cleanly — backwards compatible.
- **Telegram-themed error page** (`src/web/public/share-error.html`) — friends who hit an expired / revoked / bad-sig / not-found / file-missing link now get a branded card with icon, friendly title, and explanation instead of the raw `{"error":"Share link is not valid","code":"expired"}` JSON. Browsers get the HTML; `Accept: application/json` callers keep the JSON for backwards compat. Status code stays `401` so external scanners can't enumerate which link ids are valid.

### SW
- VERSION bumped `'v240'` → `'v250'` (semver-aligned for v2.5.x line). Service worker shell pre-cache picks up the new `share-error.html` automatically.

### Docs
- New `docs/BACKUP.md` — full provider walkthroughs, encryption / passphrase management, restore procedure, cost notes per provider.
- `docs/DEPLOY.md` — `BACKUP_WORKERS_PER_DEST` env var documented; share-link URL format note.
- `README.md` — backup bullet under "Why people use it", updated keywords.

## [2.4.0] — 2026-05-04

### Added — Maintenance pages (4 admin-only surfaces)
- **`#/maintenance/duplicates`** — full-page Find Duplicates: scan, group-by-hash review table, per-row keep/delete, bulk "keep oldest / newest", inline Re-index button. Replaces the in-Settings sheet.
- **`#/maintenance/thumbs`** — full-page Build Thumbnails: cache stats, fire-and-forget build with WS progress (`thumbs_progress`/`thumbs_done`), wipe-cache action, ffmpeg capability badge.
- **`#/maintenance/nsfw`** — full-page NSFW review with **5-tier dynamic logic** (def_not / maybe_not / uncertain / maybe / def, boundaries 0.3 / 0.5 / 0.7 / 0.9). Stats cards, score histogram (vanilla SVG), per-tier paginated list, per-row Keep / Delete / Whitelist / Re-classify, bulk-action toolbar, scan controls. Replaces the binary above/below threshold review.
- **`#/maintenance/logs`** — realtime server log viewer (admin). Subscribes to the new WS `log` channel + backfills the in-memory ring buffer via `GET /api/maintenance/logs/recent`. Filter by source / level, search, pause, autoscroll, download `.log`. Stops you from needing `docker logs` for routine debugging.
- All four pages enforce admin via `ADMIN_ROUTE_PREFIXES` (`router.js`) + `data-admin-only` (CSS gate) + the existing server-side `guestGate` middleware.

### Added — Re-index from disk
- **`POST /api/maintenance/reindex`** + companion `/status` — walks `data/downloads/` and `INSERT OR IGNORE`s catalogue rows for files the DB doesn't know about (idempotent on `(group_id, message_id)`). Recovers from a wiped DB without re-downloading from Telegram. Fire-and-forget, broadcasts `reindex_progress` + `reindex_done`. Surfaced from `/maintenance/duplicates`.

### Added — Realtime log channel
- **`log({ source, level, msg })`** helper in `src/web/server.js` writes into a 1000-entry ring buffer and broadcasts a `log` WS message. Mirrors to stdout/stderr so the docker-logs path keeps working. Used by NSFW scan progress, thumbs build, dedup, reindex, and a thumb-miss tally.
- **Notification bell** in the content-header — surfaces warn / error events from the WS `log` stream. Badge count, persisted last-50 in `localStorage`, browser tab title flash on important events while the tab is hidden, "Clear all" action.

### Added — HEIC display + sharp 0.34
- **HEIC / HEIF inline transcode** — `/files/<path>?inline=1` for `.heic` / `.heif` returns a JPEG via sharp + libvips libheif (built into sharp 0.34). Cached at `data/thumbs/heic-cache/<sha-of-path-and-mtime>.jpg`; raw bytes still serve when `?inline=1` is absent. iPhone uploads now preview in the gallery instead of falling into the "documents" bucket.
- `core/downloader.js` recognises `.heic` / `.heif` / `.gif` as `photo`, `.webm` as `video`, `.opus` / `.flac` as `audio`.

### Added — `npm run doctor` (diagnostics CLI)
- One-shot runtime check: Node version + ABI, config load, `better-sqlite3` open + row count (with `npm rebuild` hint on `NODE_MODULE_VERSION` mismatch), `data/` writability, port availability (honours `PORT`), `ffmpeg` on `PATH`. Cross-platform, non-interactive — safe for CI / Docker. Exits `1` on any blocking failure.

### Added — Auto-save Settings (debounced)
- Every Setting input now writes to `/api/config` 800 ms after the last edit, no scroll-to-Save round trip required. Inline status indicator: idle → "Editing…" → "Saving…" → "Saved at HH:MM:SS" with an ARIA-live region for screen readers. Tab-hide and field-blur flush early so unsaved edits don't vanish on tab close. The manual Save button stays as an early-flush escape hatch.

### Added — Mobile content-header overhaul
- Header restructured for narrow viewports: paste-link / stories / view-mode / refresh collapse into a `⋮` overflow menu at <640 px. Subtitle hidden, avatar/title shrunk, engine pill icon-only at <380 px. Always-visible cluster: menu / avatar / title / engine pill / 🔔 bell / select-mode.
- Per-page header icon (settings → ⚙️, queue → ✅, maintenance pages → relevant icons) — replaces the bug where a previously-selected group's photo bled across pages.

### Added — Force HTTPS hardening
- Confirm sheet on enable (defends against accidental clicks that lock the operator out of a fresh dashboard with no TLS cert behind it).
- `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains` on every secure response when Force HTTPS is on.
- New TLS-lockdown section in `docs/DEPLOY.md` with pre-flight checklist.

### Changed — Architecture
- **CSS extracted from `index.html`** — the inline `<style>` block (1525 lines) is now `src/web/public/css/main.css`, served via `<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/main.css?v=2.4.0">`. Service worker preloads it via `SHELL_URLS`. `index.html` shrunk from 3847 → 2325 lines (-1522). Easier to edit, browser + SW cache the stylesheet independently of HTML changes. Future split into per-concern files (theme / layout / gallery / components) is queued for v2.4.1.
- **Docker base image: `node:20.20.2-alpine` → `node:20.20.2-bookworm-slim`.** `onnxruntime-node` ships glibc-only prebuilt binaries — alpine's musl libc could not load them, so containers died at boot with `Error loading shared library ld-linux-x86-64.so.2`. Bookworm-slim has glibc out of the box. `apk` swapped for `apt-get`, `su-exec` for `gosu` (drop-in equivalent), entrypoint path `/sbin/tini` → `/usr/bin/tini`. Image grows ~40 MB but actually runs.
- **`docker-compose.yml` defaults `TRUST_PROXY=1`** — most Docker deployments are behind a reverse proxy, and without this the rate-limiter floods stderr with `ERR_ERL_UNEXPECTED_X_FORWARDED_FOR` validation warnings on every request.
- **Background-job pattern** — `thumbs/build-all`, `dedup/scan`, `nsfw/scan`, `reindex` all return 200 immediately and stream progress via WS. Companion `/status` endpoints (`/dedup/status`, `/thumbs/build/status`, `/reindex/status`, `/nsfw/status`) let a re-opened page recover the live state without polling. Closing the tab no longer kills work in flight.
- **Lint cleanup** — dead code removed across core / web / scripts / tests (`directoryCache`, `normalizeName()`, `hasMissingKeys`, debug `RAW EVENT` block + `peerId` derivation, unused imports `Api` / `closeTopSheet` / `api` / `escapeHtml` / `getFileIcon` / `insertDownload`, unused `chatId` / `lastCrashTime` / `DB_PATH`, destructured `id` → `_id`). Net `-19` warnings, no behaviour change.

### Fixed
- **`navigateTo is not defined` race on first click** — the inline `onclick="navigateTo('…')"` handlers on sidebar nav-items would throw whenever `loadGroups()` / `loadStats()` rejected before app.js's `init()` finished, because the `window.navigateTo = …` assignments lived after the await chain. Hoisted the entire `window.*` exposure block to right after the synchronous bootstrap so the bindings are live the moment the module finishes parsing — independent of any later network failure.
- **Backfill flashing "Done" milliseconds after Start** — `core/history.js` swallowed errors via `catch + emit('error')` then unconditionally `emit('complete')` in `finally`, so the Promise returned by `downloadHistory` resolved cleanly no matter what failed. The most common surface was "no available account can read this group" — operators saw a green "Done" pill with zero downloads. The catch now re-throws after emitting so server.js's `.then() / .catch()` actually routes failures to `history_error`. Added log channel emission with a hint for the most common cause (no account in group).
- **Backfill failures invisible on the realtime log channel** — both the user-triggered (`POST /api/history`) and the auto-spawn (first-add bootstrap, post-restart catch-up) paths now emit a structured `log` event with the group name, group id, and a friendly hint when the message points at account access.
- **Sidebar `chat-row` overlapping the sticky search input on scroll** — the sidebar groups header was at `z-10` and the avatar's type-badge inside `chat-row` was also `z-10`. Source-order made the chat-rows win on scroll-up. Bumped the sticky header to `z-20`.
- **Downloaded Groups all showing the megaphone icon regardless of type** — `/api/groups` and `/api/downloads` didn't carry `type`, so the avatar fell back to an id-prefix heuristic (every `-100…` id ⇒ channel) which conflated supergroups with channels. Both endpoints now enrich rows with `type` from the dialogs cache (channel / group / user / bot), matching what Manage Groups already shows.
- **`opacity: 0` on cached thumbnails leaving tiles permanently invisible** — the lazy-loader was setting `el.src = el.dataset.src` BEFORE attaching `onload`, which meant cached images fired their `load` event synchronously before the handler attached, so the `.loaded` class was never added and CSS kept the tile at `opacity: 0`. Handler now attaches first; we also add `el.complete` recovery for the same-tick race and an `onerror` fallback so broken thumbs don't stay invisible either.
- **Disk-usage footer reading stale "930 KB" after Purge all** — when the DB sum is zero (catalogue empty / freshly purged) `/api/stats` now walks `data/downloads/` recursively for the real on-disk size and refreshes `disk_usage.json` instead of trusting the legacy snapshot.
- **`tests/db.test.js` no longer touches the user's real `data/db.sqlite`** — the test now points the DB module at an `os.tmpdir()` mkdtemp via the new `TGDL_DATA_DIR` env override and removes the directory in `afterAll`.
- **Header avatar bleed** — clicking a group in the sidebar then navigating to Settings used to leave that group's photo in the header. Reset on every page change + per-page icon mapping.
- **Engine pill queue-count badge invisible on small phones** — the `<380 px` icon-only collapse zeroed `font-size` for the whole pill including the inline queue-count digit. Restored `font-size: 10px` on the badge inside the same media query.
- **Maintenance Thumbs page auto-completing the build before it finished** — `POST /thumbs/build-all` is fire-and-forget but the page treated the immediate 200 as completion (rendering "Built undefined / undefined" toasts), then failed any subsequent click with a 409. Now the page kicks off the build, waits for `thumbs_done` over WS, and recovers in-flight state via `GET /thumbs/build/status` on re-mount so closing the tab + coming back resumes the progress bar.
- **Maintenance Logs viewport overflow on landscape mobile** — `height: calc(100vh - 320px) min-height: 320px` evaluated negative on a 360 px-tall viewport and the min-height fallback then cropped the bottom rows under the bottom nav. Switched to `clamp(240px, calc(100vh - 320px), 70vh)`.
- **Maintenance Logs search jank** — full re-render of the 1 000-line buffer fired on every keystroke. Debounced 150 ms.
- **Empty gallery left with no actionable hint** — the "ทำไมบางกลุ่มไม่เจอ media" pattern. The empty state now shows a contextual title + body + admin action buttons (Run Backfill / Group Settings / Re-index from disk for per-group, Add account / Manage groups for all-media), so the operator knows where to go next.
- **Cloudflare 524 timeout on `/api/maintenance/dedup/scan`** — the SHA-256 sweep was awaited inside the POST handler, so on a 50 GB library the request could outlast Cloudflare's 100 s tunnel timeout long before completing. Converted to the same fire-and-forget pattern as thumbs / nsfw / reindex: 200 immediately, progress + final result via WS (`dedup_progress` / `dedup_done`), recovery via `GET /dedup/status`. Closing the tab no longer cancels the scan; opening the page from another device shows the live progress.
- **`onnxruntime-node` glibc crash defended at the process level** — even with the Dockerfile on bookworm-slim and the dep moved to `optionalDependencies` (see below), an existing install with the broken module on disk could still emit `Error loading shared library ld-linux-x86-64.so.2` and bring the process down via unhandledRejection. Added an explicit guard in `src/web/server.js` (and `src/index.js` for the CLI) that recognises native-load failure messages and logs once-and-survives instead of crashing.
- **`ERR_ERL_UNEXPECTED_X_FORWARDED_FOR` validation warning storm** — express-rate-limit v7's self-help diagnostic ran on every request when `trust proxy` was at the default `false`. We now default `trust proxy` to `'loopback'` (overridable via `TRUST_PROXY` env), and we explicitly disable the `xForwardedForHeader` + `trustProxy` validators on the rate-limiter since we configure trust proxy correctly ourselves. Other validators stay enabled.

### Changed — Cross-platform support
- **`@huggingface/transformers` → `optionalDependencies`.** It transitively pulls in `onnxruntime-node`, whose Linux prebuilds are glibc-only and crash on musl images (alpine) at module load. Moving it out of `dependencies` means `npm install` on any platform is safe by default; the NSFW review feature is now an opt-in install (`npm install @huggingface/transformers`). `npm run doctor` reports availability so operators know whether the feature is wired up.

### Changed — Build thumbnails state shape
- Field names in `_thumbBuildState` and the `thumbs_progress` / `thumbs_done` WS payloads aligned with what `buildAllThumbnails()` returns: `processed / total / built / skipped / errored / scanned`. Replaces the placeholder `done / errors` keys, which made the maintenance log line read `done=undefined errors=undefined`.

### Changed — Multi-client coordination
- Maintenance pages (Find duplicates, Build thumbnails, NSFW scan, Re-index) now hydrate from `GET /<feature>/status` on (re-)entry. Starting a long-running job on a phone now disables the corresponding button on the desktop client too — and vice versa — because state lives on the server and the front-end is a renderer.
- **Express `ERR_ERL_UNEXPECTED_X_FORWARDED_FOR` warning spam** — silenced by the `TRUST_PROXY=1` default in `docker-compose.yml`.

### Changed — DB
- **`src/core/db.js` honours `TGDL_DATA_DIR`** — set the env var to relocate the data root (used by the test isolation above; also lets Docker / multi-instance deploys override the path without symlinks). Default behaviour unchanged.
- New tier-aware NSFW APIs: `getNsfwTierCounts`, `getNsfwHistogram`, `getNsfwListByTier`, `reclassifyNsfw`, `unwhitelistNsfw`. Tier dictionary exported as `NSFW_TIERS`.

### Changed — Dependencies
- **`sharp ^0.33.5` → `^0.34.5`** to dedupe with the nested copy `@huggingface/transformers` already pulls in. node_modules sheds the duplicate libvips and platform binaries. Bonus: HEIC / HEIF input + output now available out of the box.

### SW
- VERSION bumped `'v48'` → `'v240'` (semver-aligned for the v2.4.x line). `/css/main.css` added to `SHELL_URLS` so the new stylesheet preloads on install.

### Docs
- `docs/DEPLOY.md` — new "Force HTTPS (TLS lockdown)" section with pre-flight checklist.
- `docs/DEPLOY.md` — `TGDL_DATA_DIR` documented in the env vars table.
- `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` — `npm run doctor` documented as the first stop.
- `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md` — `npm run doctor` in the CLI cheatsheet + contributor onboarding.

## [2.3.48] — 2026-05-02

### Added
- **`npm run doctor`** — runtime diagnostics in one command. Reports Node version + ABI, config load, `better-sqlite3` open + row count (with rebuild hint on `NODE_MODULE_VERSION` mismatch), `data/` writability, port availability (honours `PORT`), and `ffmpeg` on `PATH`. Cross-platform (Windows / macOS / Linux), non-interactive — safe for CI / Docker. Exits 1 on any blocking failure.

### Fixed
- **Disk-usage footer no longer reads stale "930 KB" after Purge all** — when the DB sum is zero (catalogue empty / freshly purged) `/api/stats` now walks `data/downloads/` recursively for the real on-disk size and refreshes `disk_usage.json` instead of trusting the legacy snapshot. The old cache was written sparingly by earlier downloader versions and never invalidated on purge, so a wiped dashboard could keep footer-reporting a multi-week-old size.

### Changed
- **`tests/db.test.js` no longer touches the user's real `data/db.sqlite`** — the test now points the DB module at an `os.tmpdir()` mkdtemp via the new `TGDL_DATA_DIR` env override and removes the directory in `afterAll`. Previously a local `npm test` would create + delete the production DB file under `data/`.
- **`src/core/db.js` honours `TGDL_DATA_DIR`** — set the env var to relocate the data root (used by the test isolation above; also lets Docker / multi-instance deploys override the path without symlinks). Default behaviour unchanged.
- **`sharp ^0.33.5` → `^0.34.5`** to dedupe with the nested copy `@huggingface/transformers` already pulls in. Same `rotate()` / `resize()` / `webp()` patterns we use are stable across the bump; node_modules sheds the duplicate libvips and platform binaries.
- Lint cleanup: dead code removed across core / web / scripts / tests (`directoryCache`, `normalizeName()`, `hasMissingKeys`, debug `RAW EVENT` block + `peerId` derivation, unused imports `Api` / `closeTopSheet` / `api` / `escapeHtml` / `getFileIcon` / `insertDownload`, unused `chatId` / `lastCrashTime` / `DB_PATH`, destructured `id` → `_id` in accounts/history/monitor). Net `-19` warnings, no behaviour change.

### SW
- VERSION bumped `'v47'` → `'v48'`.

## [2.3.47] — 2026-05-02

### Fixed — Guest scope (strict viewer)
- **Guest is a strict read-only viewer** — browse downloaded media, adjust their own appearance / video-player preferences (browser-side), sign out. Operational surfaces (Groups picker, Backfill, Queue, Engine, Maintenance, Advanced, Accounts, Rate Limits, Size Limits, Privacy/DM, Proxy, web-auth Security) are admin-only on both the front and the back.
- **Guest GET 403 on every read endpoint** — `app.use('/api', guestGate)` strips the `/api` prefix from `req.path`, so the allowlist (written with full paths) missed every entry. Now reads `req.baseUrl + req.path` and matches. Without this fix even the legitimate guest reads (downloads, groups list, stats, thumbs) returned 403.
- **`/settings` root reachable for guest** so they can use the Look & Feel chip; `/settings/<section>` deep-links honour the existing `GUEST_SETTINGS_SECTIONS` allow set (`appearance`, `video-player`).
- Settings chip-nav: System / Accounts / Downloads / Privacy & Net chips and their sections gain `data-admin-only` — guest sees only the Look & Feel chip + section.
- `#status-bar` (desktop bottom status bar) gains `data-admin-only` — its content (engine state, queue counters, WS link) is admin-info only; guest's disk/file count is in the sidebar footer.
- Admin-only init paths gated for guest in `app.js` and `settings.js` — `initStatusBar`, `initOnboarding`, `initQueue`, `initEngine`, `refreshRescueStats`, `POST /api/groups/refresh-info` all skip for guest sessions so the console stays clean.
- **Onboarding banner suppressed for guest** — JS guard in `initOnboarding` plus `body[data-role="guest"] #onboarding-banner { display: none }` belt-and-suspenders.

### Fixed — Other
- **`Cannot access '_configCache' before initialization`** crash on boot — the share-secret bootstrap IIFE awaited `readConfigSafe()` before the `let _configCache` declaration. Variable hoisted above the IIFE.
- **"Failed to load dialogs"** when no Telegram account is configured replaced with a friendly empty-state + "Add account" CTA. Server now returns `error: 'no_account'` (vs. `not_connected`) so the SPA can branch on intent.
- Settings page `<h2>` section labels removed — they duplicated the chip-nav identity. Cleaner, denser layout.

### Changed — UI polish
- **`login.html` restyled to match the dashboard theme** — brand mark on a Telegram-blue gradient disc, full `--tg-*` token swap, IBM Plex font, remixicon, soft radial glow, complete light/dark theme parity.
- **Settings tab strip: sticky-but-integrated.** `var(--tg-bg)` background sits inside the page column (no full-bleed banner), stays reachable while scrolling, doesn't read as a foreign component.
- **Sidebar gains a full-width red Sign out button** at the bottom (below the Disk/Files stats). Routes through `confirmSheet` so an accidental tap can't kick the operator out. The deeper Settings → Privacy & Net → Security → Sign out path stays for the dedicated flow.
- **Media search bar dropped from the Viewer page.** The standalone `<input id="media-search">` toolbar at the top of the gallery was rarely used — the sidebar's Downloaded Groups filter narrows by chat, the URL link picker handles "this exact message", and removing the bar gives the grid a full row of vertical real estate. The `/` keyboard shortcut to focus it is gone with it. The `Select` button moved into the page header next to Refresh, and only shows on the Viewer page (`body[data-page="viewer"]` gate).

### SW
- VERSION bumped `'v46'` → `'v47'`.

## [2.3.46] — 2026-05-02

### Changed — Settings tab strip: drop sticky + integrate with page flow
- Settings nav no longer sticky — sits flush with the page in the normal scroll flow, same pattern as the Groups page tabs (`#groups-tab-*`) and the Viewer media tabs. The sticky version floated as a foreign banner; the new version reads as part of the page header.
- Margin breakout (`-12px / -16px`) removed; the underline now lives within the page's content column instead of spanning the whole content area like a separator.
- Active indicator moved from `::after` pseudo to the chip's own `border-bottom` so the underline overlaps the nav's `border-bottom` cleanly (the standard tab-into-content pattern).
- Inactive icons drop to `opacity: 0.75` and snap to full opacity on hover/active — gives the row a calmer rest state.
- Font weight bumped to 500, padding tightened to `10px 14px` to read as proper tabs rather than buttons.

### SW
- VERSION bumped `'v45'` → `'v46'`.

## [2.3.45] — 2026-05-02

### Changed — Settings tab-strip redesign
- Settings section nav redesigned from solid pill-chips to flat underlined tabs. The pill chips fought the muted cards below them; the tab-strip sits flat against the page and matches the existing `.tab-item` pattern used by Viewer media tabs and the Group settings modal.
- Active state is `var(--tg-blue)` text + 2 px underline (no heavy fill). Sticky bar carries a single bottom border that doubles as the inactive baseline. Mask-image edge fade dropped — overflow-scroll is silent on phones, and the row fits flush on tablet+.
- HTML markup unchanged; CSS-only redesign on `.settings-chip-nav` + `.settings-chip`.

### Changed — Sidebar groups header breathing room
- Toggle button padding tweaked to `pt-3 pb-1.5` (was `py-2`) so the "Downloaded Groups" heading sits with proper top breathing room and connects more snugly to the search row below.
- Search row padding upgraded `px-2 pb-2` → `px-3 pt-1 pb-3` so it aligns horizontally with the toggle and gets honest bottom space before the chat list begins.
- Search input grew `py-1.5` → `py-2` for a more comfortable tap target.
- Sticky header now carries a soft `border-tg-border/40` bottom edge so it visibly separates from the scrolling list once the user scrolls.

### SW
- VERSION bumped `'v44'` → `'v45'`.

## [2.3.44] — 2026-05-02

### Fixed — Light/dark theme contrast pass
- **`--tg-*` CSS variables are now actually defined.** Every `var(--tg-…)` consumer (`.engine-status-pill`, `.media-item`, `.sheet-card`, `.chat-row`, `.role-pill`, `.bottom-nav`, …) silently fell back to the dark hex on a light page. Fixed via a `:root` block plus `html.theme-light` re-definition; one source of truth, both themes paint right.
- **Brand status colours darkened in light theme** to clear WCAG AA on white surfaces — `tg-blue` `#2AABEE` → `#0E78C2` (2.84:1 → 4.93:1), `tg-green` → `#008A6E`, `tg-red` → `#B91C1C`, `tg-orange` → `#B8860B`. Affects primary buttons, FAB, settings-chip active, nav-badge, links, status pills, role pills, engine pill states.
- **`:focus-visible` keyboard ring restored** — global `button:focus, input:focus, …{ outline: none }` was eclipsing it, leaving every form element + button with no visible keyboard focus. Suppression now scoped to `:not(:focus-visible)` so mouse-clicks lose the ring but keyboards keep it.
- **Sidebar `.nav-item.active` actually renders.** App was toggling `.active` in JS but no CSS rule existed, so the active page was invisible in the sidebar. Now shows a 3 px blue accent bar + tinted background.
- **Engine pill pulse halo** uses higher alpha + theme-correct green in light mode (was `rgba(79,174,78,0.20)` — invisible on a near-white header).
- **Disabled buttons** (`.tg-btn:disabled`, `.tg-btn-secondary:disabled`) now visibly distinct: `opacity: 0.5 + saturate(0.55) + cursor: not-allowed`.
- **Selection-bar Select-all / Clear** gained an underline-on-hover affordance — the buttons read as buttons, not body copy.

### Fixed — Missing light-theme overrides
- Yellow alert family (`text-yellow-400`, `bg-yellow-500/10`, `border-yellow-500/20`).
- Red alpha variants `bg-red-500/{5,15,25,30}`, `bg-red-600`, `hover:bg-red-700`, `border-red-400/60`, `hover:text-red-400`.
- Brand-blue alphas beyond `/10`+`/20`: `bg-tg-blue/{15,25}`, `border-tg-blue/30`, `hover:bg-tg-blue/{20,25}`, `hover:bg-tg-{green,orange}/20`, `border-tg-{green,orange}/30`.
- `.tab-item` (Viewer + Settings tab strips), `.skeleton` shimmer (was a navy stripe on white), `.media-item .select-badge` (was white-on-white), `.unread-pill.muted`, `.bg-gray-500` status dots, `.hover:bg-white/10` patches inside themed surfaces.
- Status pills in chat rows recoloured per theme: green/orange/grey hard-coded for dark were illegible on light surfaces.

### Added
- `.tg-input::placeholder` colour rule covers BOTH themes — dark previously fell back to a UA default that was barely legible on the panel bg.

### SW
- VERSION bumped `'v43'` → `'v44'`.

## [2.3.43] — 2026-05-02

### Added — Sidebar groups: collapse + filter
- "Downloaded Groups" header is now a button — tap to collapse/expand the list. State persists in `localStorage` (`tgdl.sidebar.groups.collapsed`).
- New filter input below the header, sticky at the top of the sidebar scroll area so it stays reachable on long lists. DOM-only filter (`filterSidebarGroups`) — no re-render, doesn't fight the existing `_lastHtml` cache, and survives WS-driven re-renders via `_reapplySidebarFilter`.
- Footer stats compacted into one row (Disk + Files share a line with leading icons), giving the list more vertical real estate.

### Fixed — Video thumbnails on stripped ffmpeg builds
- `_generateVideoThumb` now picks its codec path at boot via `_ffmpegHasLibwebp()` (cached). When libwebp is present (default Docker image) it stays on the fast single-pass `-c:v libwebp` flow. When missing (stripped Alpine/musl ffmpeg, Windows static builds) it falls back to a JPEG → sharp WebP pipeline so video thumbs still generate. The retry-at-1s-then-0s pattern is preserved on both paths; tmp JPEG is always cleaned up.

### SW
- VERSION bumped `'v42'` → `'v43'`.

## [2.3.42] — 2026-05-02

### Fixed — Settings chip-nav: no-reload section routing
- Tapping a chip from inside the Settings page no longer re-runs `loadSettings()` + `initEngine()`. The `/settings/:section` route now bypasses the full `renderPage()` when `state.currentPage === 'settings'` and just smooth-scrolls to the target wrapper. Removes the visible flicker / "reload feel" introduced in v2.3.40 and stops the IntersectionObserver from landing on the wrong card mid-rebuild.
- Deep-link resolution now prefers `#settings-<anchor>` (unique by construction on the chip-nav wrappers) over `[data-settings-section]` (legacy attribute that also lived on inner cards).
- Active chip is set immediately on click — no waiting for the IntersectionObserver to catch up after smooth-scroll completes.
- Removed a duplicate `data-settings-section="appearance"` attribute from the Appearance card; the section wrapper is now the single source of truth for that anchor.

### SW
- VERSION bumped `'v41'` → `'v42'`.

## [2.3.41] — 2026-05-02

### Added
- **Forwarder destination resolution: 3-stage fallback.** `getInputEntity` → `getEntity` (dialog-cache rescan) → hand-rolled `Api.InputPeerChannel` / `InputPeerChat` from the canonical `-100…` layout. The last-resort branch logs a yellow warning so operators can spot it, and recommends opening the channel once on the configured account if sends still fail.
- **`destination: 'saved'`** now aliases `'me'` (Saved Messages), matching common Telegram-bot phrasing.
- **TG message-id in forward log** — successful auto-forward writes `(msg #<id>)` after the destination so the destination copy is traceable from the dashboard.
- **Backfill quick presets**: "Last 5" and "Last 10" added to the per-chat history modal alongside the existing 100 / 1k / 10k / All buttons. Grid is now `grid-cols-3 sm:grid-cols-6` so the row stays one-line on tablet+.
- **Groups: "Unmonitored" tab** — third tab next to "All" / "Monitored Only", filters dialogs to chats not in the monitored set (`!d.inConfig && !d.enabled`).
- **Viewer "Select all" button** in the floating selection bar — exposes the existing `Ctrl/⌘+A` shortcut as a tap target so mobile users get the same affordance. Single source of truth: shortcut + button both call `selectAllVisible()` from `gallery-select.js`.
- **`TGDL_PORT` env override** — `docker-compose.yml` now uses `${TGDL_PORT:-3000}:3000` so a port collision on the host doesn't require a `docker-compose.yml` edit. Documented in `.env.example`.

### Refactor
- `switchGroupsTab` collapsed from a per-button toggle ladder to a `tabs.forEach` loop — adding a future tab is now a one-line array push.
- `_autoEnableSelectMode` lifted from `setupGallerySelect`'s closure to module scope so the new exported `selectAllVisible()` can reuse it.

### SW
- VERSION bumped `'v40'` → `'v41'`.

## [2.3.40] — 2026-05-02

### Changed — Mobile UI polish + Settings restructure
- Bottom-nav 6 → 5 tabs. Engine tab replaced by a header `engine-status-pill` (taps to `#/settings/engine`; running/error/reconnecting via animated dot; queue+active badge preserved).
- Settings page reorganised from a flat 15-card stack into 5 sticky-chip-nav sections: System / Accounts / Downloads / Look & Feel / Privacy & Net. Active chip mirrors the section in view via IntersectionObserver. `#/settings/<section>` deep-links unchanged.
- Per-page accent — `#content-header` now carries a 2 px underline that swaps per top-level page (Library blue / Chats green / Backfill orange / Queue cyan / Settings blue), driven by `body[data-page]`.

### Responsive + a11y
- Sidebar clamps to `min(85vw, 18rem)` so a 320 px phone always leaves a tap-out gap.
- Engine status grid `grid-cols-2 sm:grid-cols-4` (single row on tablet+, 2×2 on phone).
- View-mode menu clamps to viewport (`max-width: min(240px, calc(100vw - 24px))`).
- Header gains `pt-safe` + `@supports` height bump for notched displays.
- Bottom-nav badge offset `right: calc(50% - 1ch)` — tracks the icon regardless of font-size tier.
- Chip-nav is `role="tablist"`, sections are `role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby`. Engine pill `aria-label` reflects state via `header.engine_state`.

### Performance
- `.media-item` gains `aspect-ratio: 1 / 1`, `content-visibility: auto`, `contain-intrinsic-size: auto 200px`, panel-coloured skeleton — kills load-time layout shift and skips offscreen tiles natively.
- Image fade trimmed `0.3s → 0.18s`. Sheet transition `220ms → 180ms`; `will-change: transform` only while open.

### i18n
- 7 new keys in en.json + th.json: `settings.section.{system,accounts,downloads,appearance,network}`, `header.engine`, `header.engine_state`.

### SW
- VERSION bumped `'v39'` → `'v40'`.

## [2.3.39] — 2026-04-30

### Fixed — iOS double-tap zoom
- `body { touch-action: manipulation }` disables the double-tap-to-zoom gesture across the whole app. The HTML viewport's `user-scalable=no` is intentionally ignored on iOS 10+, so `touch-action` is the only reliable way to silence it. Pinch-zoom is preserved; per-element overrides (`#image-container`, `.lasso-active`) keep their custom touch handling.

### SW
- VERSION bumped `'v38'` → `'v39'`.

## [2.3.38] — 2026-04-30

### Added — Gallery picker: mobile gestures
- **Touch long-press** → enter select-mode + toggle (with `navigator.vibrate(10)` haptic when supported).
- **Drag after long-press** → continue selecting (Android Material pattern). Each tile the finger crosses is added once.
- **Two-finger drag** → lasso (iOS Photos pattern). One-finger drag is reserved for page scroll.
- Pinch-to-zoom cancels the in-progress long-press cleanly so it never trips a select.
- Long-press logic consolidated into `gallery-select.js`; the duplicate handler in `setupGalleryGestures` is gone.

### Docs
- README updated with the new touch gesture matrix.

### SW
- VERSION bumped `'v37'` → `'v38'`.

## [2.3.37] — 2026-04-30

### Docs
- README, `docs/API.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/DEPLOY.md`, `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` brought current with the v2.3.x feature set: guest role, share-links, dedup, thumbnails, NSFW review tool, auto-update, smart-resume backfill, gallery gestures, view-mode picker.
- New WebSocket event matrix in `docs/API.md`.
- New SPA + backend module index in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- New auto-update + ffmpeg + thumbnail concurrency env vars documented in `docs/DEPLOY.md`.

### SW
- VERSION bumped `'v36'` → `'v37'`.

## [2.3.36] — 2026-04-30

### Added — Gallery picker: desktop-grade gestures
- **Drag-to-select (lasso)** — rubber-band rectangle selects every overlapping tile.
- **Ctrl / Cmd + click** — toggle one tile, auto-enables select mode.
- **Shift + click** — range-select from the last anchor to here.
- **Ctrl / Cmd + A** — select all visible tiles.
- **Esc** — exit select mode + clear.
- **Delete / Backspace** — bulk-delete the current selection.
- All updates are in-place — toggling `.is-selected` on the matching tile, no full grid re-render. Lasso stays smooth on 1000-tile galleries.
- Long-press on touch (existing) still works.

### SW
- VERSION bumped `'v35'` → `'v36'`.

## [2.3.35] — 2026-04-30

### Changed — View modes: polished List + dropdown picker
- **List mode** redesigned — proper grid columns (thumb · name+group · size · date · open), hover row highlight, divider between rows, responsive (collapses to thumb+name+open on mobile).
- **Dropdown picker** replaces the cycle button — Grid / Compact / List shown together with active checkmark. No more clicking through to find the mode you want.
- Tile markup unified across modes; switching is pure CSS (instant, no re-render, no scroll drift).

### SW
- VERSION bumped `'v34'` → `'v35'`.

## [2.3.34] — 2026-04-30

### Changed — Backfill: smart resume + auto-spawn
- **Smart resume** — `iterMessages` now uses `maxId: minMessageId - 1` (or `minId: maxMessageId + 1` for catch-up) instead of walking every message from newest. Resuming a partially-completed backfill is ~80-90% faster.
- **Per-group lock** — second click on Backfill while one is running returns 409 with `code: 'ALREADY_RUNNING'` instead of spawning a duplicate iterator.
- **Auto-backfill on first add** — enabling a brand-new group with zero rows in `downloads` triggers a background backfill of the last N messages (default 100, configurable, 0 = disabled).
- **Auto catch-up after restart** — monitor's boot-time top-message check now spawns a `catch-up` backfill if the gap to the last stored row exceeds the configured threshold.
- **3 new history modes** surfaced in WS payloads + UI: `pull-older` / `catch-up` / `rescan`.

### Added — Auto-NSFW on download (if enabled)
- Every successful download fires `pregenerateNsfw(id)` alongside `pregenerateThumb(id)` — newly-arrived photos get classified in the background, no need to wait for the next batch scan. No-op when `advanced.nsfw.enabled` is false.

### Config (no hardcode)
- New `advanced.history.{ autoFirstBackfill, autoFirstLimit, autoCatchUp, autoCatchUpThreshold, batchInsertSize, batchInsertMaxAgeMs }`. All clamped server-side; defaults preserve current behavior.
- New Settings → Advanced rows for the auto-backfill knobs.

### SW
- VERSION bumped `'v33'` → `'v34'`.

## [2.3.33] — 2026-04-30

### Added — NSFW review tool (Phase 1: photos)
- Maintenance → "Scan images for NSFW (18+)" — classifies every photo locally via `@huggingface/transformers` (WASM, runs on Win / macOS / glibc-Linux / Alpine / ARM identically).
- Surfaces photos the classifier scored as **NOT 18+** (deletion candidates for a curated 18+ library) in a paginated review sheet — tick + bulk delete with confirm.
- Per-row "Mark as 18+" whitelists genuine 18+ false-negatives so future scans skip them.
- Background scan with WS progress + browser notification on completion. Cancel any time.
- Opt-in via Settings → Advanced → NSFW review tool. Threshold + concurrency + model id all config-driven (no hardcoded values). Model downloads once to `data/models/`.
- Config namespace: `advanced.nsfw.{ enabled, model, threshold, concurrency, batchSize, fileTypes, cacheDir }`.
- DB columns added (idempotent migration): `nsfw_score`, `nsfw_checked_at`, `nsfw_whitelist`. Indexes for unscanned-row scan and review-sort queries.

### SW
- VERSION bumped `'v32'` → `'v33'`.

## [2.3.32] — 2026-04-30

### Changed — Media gallery: smooth on big libraries
- Infinite-scroll page-2+ loads now append only the new tiles (`insertAdjacentHTML`) instead of re-rendering the whole grid. O(N_new) per scroll page, not O(N_total).
- WS `file_deleted` removes the single matching tile from the DOM in place — no full re-render.
- Click handling switched to event delegation; per-tile listeners gone.
- Search uses AbortController + sequence tag — fast typing cancels in-flight requests, no out-of-order race. Debounce 250 ms → 200 ms.

### SW
- VERSION bumped `'v31'` → `'v32'`.

## [2.3.31] — 2026-04-30

### Changed — Queue page: gradual load + in-place progress patches
- Append-only rendering: 50 rows on first paint, 50 more appended via IntersectionObserver as you scroll.
- Live progress events patch the matching row in place — no full re-render per WS tick.
- Search input debounced 120 ms; filter / sort / search reset scroll to top.
- Replaces the prior absolute-positioning virtualiser; smoother on large queues.

### Removed — Live downloads list from the Engine card
- The per-row live list duplicated the Queue page; replaced with a "View full queue" link.
- Engine card now focuses on monitor lifecycle + headline counters.

### SW
- VERSION bumped `'v30'` → `'v31'`.

## [2.3.30] — 2026-04-30

### Added — One-click in-dashboard auto-update (Docker)

A new **Install update** button in Settings → Maintenance (and on the status-bar update pill) pulls the latest container image and recreates the running container in place — same effect as `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d` but triggered from the UI. The data volume, config, and Telegram sessions are preserved verbatim; the SQLite database is snapshotted to `data/backups/` before the swap.

#### Security model — dashboard never touches `/var/run/docker.sock`

The web process intentionally does not get the Docker socket. Instead, the swap is performed by an opt-in `containrrr/watchtower:1.7.1` sidecar that:

- Has a **read-only** mount of `/var/run/docker.sock`.
- Runs with `WATCHTOWER_LABEL_ENABLE=true`, scoping operations to ONLY the container carrying the `com.centurylinklabs.watchtower.enable=true` label (added to `telegram-downloader` in `docker-compose.yml`). Even if compromised, watchtower cannot touch unrelated apps on the same host.
- Exposes its HTTP API behind a bearer token (`WATCHTOWER_HTTP_API_TOKEN`) that lives in `.env` and never enters `config.json`.

A hypothetical RCE in the dashboard cannot escalate to host root because the dashboard never sees the socket — it can only POST to watchtower's `/v1/update`, which is bounded to "pull and recreate the labeled container".

#### Data preservation

- The downloads volume (`./data:/app/data`) is bind-mounted; container recreation never touches it.
- `data/config.json`, `data/web-sessions.json`, `data/sessions/*.enc`, and `data/db.sqlite` all live under that mount.
- Before triggering watchtower the server runs `PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)` and copies the DB to `data/backups/db-pre-update-<utc-stamp>.sqlite` (most-recent 5 snapshots kept).
- Schema migrations (`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN`) in `core/db.js` are idempotent and forward-compatible — older databases are upgraded transparently on first boot of the new image.

#### Setup (opt-in)

Existing installs continue to work unchanged. To enable the button:

1. Generate a token: `openssl rand -hex 32`.
2. Put it in `.env` next to `docker-compose.yml`:

   ```
   WATCHTOWER_HTTP_API_TOKEN=<hex>
   ```

3. Boot with the new profile:

   ```
   docker compose --profile auto-update up -d
   ```

Without the token (or without the profile) the dashboard renders an explanatory tooltip and falls back to linking the GitHub release page.

#### UI

- **Status-bar update pill** — clicking it now opens a chooser sheet with two actions: **Install vX.Y.Z** (one-click swap) and **View release notes** (GitHub).
- **Settings → Maintenance → Install update** — same chooser, plus a status line showing whether auto-update is ready, requires the profile, or is in standalone mode.
- **Full-screen "Updating…" overlay** appears the moment the swap is initiated, so the operator knows the imminent disconnect is intentional.
- **Auto-reconnect + auto-reload** — the SPA's existing WS reconnect logic re-establishes the connection once the new container's healthcheck passes; a version-change check then reloads the page so the new SPA bundle is live.

#### New endpoints

- `GET /api/update/status` — capability probe (`{ available, inDocker, watchtowerConfigured }`). Drives the disabled/help states in the UI.
- `POST /api/update` (admin-only) — snapshots the DB, calls watchtower, broadcasts `update_started` over WS, returns 200 with the snapshot path. Returns 503 with `code: 'AUTO_UPDATE_UNAVAILABLE'` and an actionable message when the sidecar isn't reachable.

#### Files

- `src/core/updater.js` — capability probe + DB snapshot + watchtower client.
- `docker-compose.yml` — opt-in `watchtower` service under the `auto-update` profile, with the label allowlist + HTTP API enabled.
- `.env.example` — new file documenting `WATCHTOWER_HTTP_API_TOKEN` (gitignored via existing `.env*` rule).

### SW
- VERSION bumped `'v29'` → `'v30'`.

## [2.3.29] — 2026-04-30

### Added — Server-side WebP thumbnails for the gallery

The gallery used to load full-size source files into every grid tile (or skip the preview entirely on mobile video). It now serves compact, server-generated WebP thumbnails — far smaller transfers, no decoder pressure on the client, and previews work consistently across image, video, and audio-with-cover-art on every viewport.

- **`src/core/thumbs.js`** — single helper exposing `getOrCreateThumb(id, w)`.
  - Image source → sharp resize → WebP (quality 70, effort 6). Honors EXIF orientation.
  - Video source → ffmpeg seeks 1 s in, scales + encodes to WebP in a **single pass** (no intermediate JPEG → sharp transcode), reading nothing past the first keyframe. ~10× faster than grab-then-resize.
  - Audio source → extracts the embedded cover-art (`attached_pic` stream) when present.
  - Cache lives at `data/thumbs/<sha-of-id+w>.webp`. Atomic publish via `.tmp → final` rename — a crash mid-write never produces a poisoned cache hit.
- **`GET /api/thumbs/:id?w=240`** (auth-gated, allowed for guest sessions) — cache-first, sends `Cache-Control: public, max-age=86400, immutable` + `Last-Modified` so the browser HTTP cache absorbs subsequent grid scrolls. Width snaps to `[120, 200, 240, 320, 480]` so a hostile caller can't fork a generation per pixel.
- **Concurrency**: image jobs run 8 in parallel (sharp is libvips C, RAM-bound); video jobs run 3 in parallel (ffmpeg pins a CPU core). Both env-overridable. In-flight de-duplication collapses 50 simultaneous requests for the same `(id, w)` into a single generation, so a fast scroll never spawns a job storm.
- **Auto-generation on download** — `pregenerateThumb(id)` fires from `registerDownload` after every successful insert (background, non-blocking, queues behind the same per-kind semaphores). The first gallery scroll already finds the WebP in cache.
- **Cache invalidation** — single-file delete, bulk-delete, and dedup-delete all call `purgeThumbsForDownload(id)` so a stale thumb never keeps serving bytes after the source file is gone.
- **Maintenance UI**:
  - **Build thumbnails for older files** — sweeps every download row that lacks a default-width thumb and queues generation. Honours the per-kind concurrency caps; broadcasts `thumbs_progress` over WS for a determinate progress bar. Single in-flight guard.
  - **Wipe cache** (refresh icon next to Build) — drops every cached WebP. Useful after a quality tweak or corruption scare; on-demand generation refills the cache on the next scroll.
  - Cache stat line ("N cached, X MB · ffmpeg unavailable — image-only" when applicable) sits under the row.

### Cross-platform install — no setup required

Out-of-the-box on every supported platform:

- **Standalone Win / macOS / glibc-Linux** — `npm install` pulls `sharp` (musl + glibc prebuilts) plus the optional `@ffmpeg-installer/ffmpeg` (bundles a static binary per platform). Zero manual setup.
- **Docker (alpine/musl)** — Dockerfile now `apk add --no-cache ffmpeg` so the system binary is on PATH. The npm `@ffmpeg-installer/ffmpeg` is moved to `optionalDependencies` so its glibc-only postinstall never fails the alpine `npm ci`.
- **Resolver order** — `process.env.FFMPEG_PATH` → `/usr/bin/ffmpeg` → `/usr/local/bin/ffmpeg` → `@ffmpeg-installer/ffmpeg` → bare `ffmpeg`. All exposed via `hasFfmpeg()` so the `/api/maintenance/thumbs/stats` payload tells the UI when video / audio-cover thumbs are unavailable on this host.

### Frontend

- Gallery tiles for images and videos render `<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/api/thumbs/<id>?w=…">`. Mobile and desktop share the same code path — no more "blank black tile" on iOS Safari for video posters.
- Dedup-sheet preview thumbnails switched from `/files/<path>?inline=1` (full file) to `/api/thumbs/<id>?w=120` (~5-15 KB).
- SW bypass for `/api/thumbs/` so the SW cache doesn't balloon for libraries with thousands of tiles; the browser HTTP cache + `immutable` Cache-Control handles repeat fetches efficiently.

### CPU/GPU note

All generation is CPU-side (sharp via libvips, ffmpeg via libwebp). No GPU acceleration — keeps the deployment story zero-config across every host.

### SW
- VERSION bumped `'v28'` → `'v29'`.

## [2.3.28] — 2026-04-30

### Changed — Share-link limits and history retention are now config-driven
Removed the hardcoded TTL bounds, rate-limit thresholds, and history retention window introduced in earlier 2.3.x releases. Operators can now tune these via `config.advanced` without recompiling.

- **`advanced.share`** (new namespace) — `ttlMinSec`, `ttlMaxSec`, `ttlDefaultSec`, `rateLimitWindowMs`, `rateLimitMax`. Defaults preserve the previous behavior (60s / 90d / 7d / 60s / 60). Each field is clamped on save and applied immediately on `config_updated` (no restart). The share-link rate-limit middleware reads the current values per-request via function-form `windowMs` / `limit`.
- **`advanced.history.retentionDays`** (new) — was hardcoded to 30; now configurable, range 1-3650. Resolved at every read of the on-disk job list so a save takes effect on the next prune.
- `share.js` exports `applyShareLimits()` and `getShareLimits()`; the original `TTL_*_SEC` constants stay exported as `*_DEFAULT` aliases for callers (and the test suite) that want the spec values.

### Tests
6 new tests covering `applyShareLimits` / `getShareLimits` (default revert, range clamping, inverted-bounds rejection, 10-year ceiling cap, NEVER sentinel preserved). Full suite: 99 / 99 passing.

### SW
- VERSION bumped `'v27'` → `'v28'`.

## [2.3.27] — 2026-04-30

### Added — Token-based shareable media links
Admins can mint signed share-URLs that let a non-user (e.g. a friend) stream or download a single media file without logging into the dashboard.

- **HMAC-SHA256 signed URLs** — `/share/<linkId>?exp=<epoch>&sig=<43-char-base64url>`. The sig binds `linkId|exp` so flipping either invalidates it. Verified with `crypto.timingSafeEqual` (length-checked first to avoid early-return timing leaks).
- **Per-server secret** in `config.web.shareSecret` — 32 random bytes, lazy-generated on first boot, persisted via the existing atomic config writer. Rotating it invalidates every outstanding link.
- **`share_links` table** is the source of truth for revocation + audit (`access_count`, `last_accessed_at`, optional `label`). FK `ON DELETE CASCADE` on `download_id` so deleting/purging a file kills every outstanding link automatically. `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON` set per-connection for the cascade to fire.
- **Public `GET /share/:linkId`** — registered BEFORE `checkAuth` and added to `PUBLIC_PATH_PREFIXES`. Three independent gates: rate limiter (60/min/IP), HMAC verify, then DB row check (revoked/expired). All failure modes return 401 with a body code (`bad_sig` / `revoked` / `expired`) so an external scanner can't enumerate which links exist. Hands off to `safeResolveDownload` + `res.sendFile` so **Range requests work** end-to-end (videos can be scrubbed). `Cache-Control: no-store` + `X-Frame-Options: DENY` + `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`.
- **Admin API `/api/share/links*`** (admin-only via the chokepoint added in v2.3.26):
  - `POST /api/share/links` — body `{ downloadId, ttlSeconds?, label? }` → returns `{ url, expiresAt, id }`. TTL clamped to `[60s, 90 days]`. **`ttlSeconds: 0` = "never expires"** — sentinel honored end-to-end (DB stores `expires_at = 0`, verifier skips the time gate, frontend renders "Never expires").
  - `GET /api/share/links?downloadId=…` — list links for one file (Share sheet) or all (Maintenance sheet).
  - `DELETE /api/share/links/:id` — revoke. Idempotent.
- **UI: Share button in viewer modal** (next to Delete/Download, marked `data-admin-only`). Opens a sheet with TTL radio (1h / 24h / 7d / 30d / 90d / Never), optional label, "Create share link" button (auto-copies on success), and a list of existing links with per-row Copy / Revoke + access counter.
- **UI: Maintenance → Active share links** sheet — search across filename / group / label, "Active only" toggle, per-row Copy / Revoke. Single source of truth for the admin's outstanding link inventory.
- **Service Worker bypass** for `/share/*` — never cache, so a revoked link can't keep serving from the SW.

### Added — Download-time deduplication (no-duplicate writes)
The downloader now hashes every file the moment it lands on disk and folds duplicates into the existing copy.

- **`src/core/checksum.js`** — single canonical `sha256OfFile(absPath)` helper. Every code path that hashes media (the post-write check in `downloader.js`, the on-demand catch-up scan in `dedup.js`, any future verification flow) imports this one function. Same algorithm (SHA-256), same encoding (lowercase hex, 64 chars), same streaming read strategy. `dedup.js`'s previous local `hashFile` is now a thin alias.
- **Downloader** computes the SHA-256 right after the atomic `.part → final` rename, then queries the DB for an existing row with the same `file_hash` AND `file_size`. If one exists AND its file is still present on disk:
  - The new copy is `unlink`ed.
  - The new DB row is inserted with `file_path` pointing at the existing file (so the gallery shows the file in this group too without storing duplicate bytes).
  - `incrementDiskUsage(0)` — disk-rotator quota stays accurate.
  - `download_complete` event carries `deduped: true` for monitor logs.
- Hash failures (rare — race with sweepers) fall through and store the row normally; the existing on-demand `dedup` scan picks them up later.

### Tests
21 new tests in `tests/share.test.js`: secret bootstrap (generation / regeneration / fingerprint), sign / verify round-trip with tamper rejection (linkId, exp, sig), base64url shape, secret-rotation invalidates, TTL clamp (defaults / floor / ceiling / NEVER sentinel / null vs 0 distinction), URL builder, sig-masking helper. Full suite: 93 / 93 passing.

### SW
- VERSION bumped `'v26'` → `'v27'`.

## [2.3.26] — 2026-04-30

### Added — Guest role (read-only viewer alongside admin)
The dashboard now supports an opt-in **read-only "guest" role** alongside the admin password. Guests can browse media and watch videos but cannot delete files, change settings, or manage Telegram accounts. Their video player preferences (autoplay/volume/etc.) save to localStorage and are independent from admin's.

- **`config.web.guestPasswordHash` + `config.web.guestEnabled`** — new optional config keys. If unset the dashboard behaves exactly as before.
- **Sessions carry a role** — `data/web-sessions.json` records now include `role: 'admin' | 'guest'`. Legacy sessions (no role field) default to admin; no forced re-login on upgrade.
- **Default-deny `/api` chokepoint for guests** — a single middleware after `checkAuth` consults an explicit allowlist (`GET /api/downloads*`, `GET /api/stats`, `GET /api/groups` (read), `GET /api/queue/snapshot`, `GET /api/monitor/status`, `GET /api/history*`, `POST /api/logout`). Anything not on the list returns `403 {adminRequired:true}`. New mutation routes are admin-gated for free.
- **`POST /api/auth/guest-password`** (admin-only) — set/enable/disable/clear the guest password from Settings → Dashboard Security. Rejects equality with the admin password (would render the guest role unreachable). Disabling or clearing the password also revokes every active guest session immediately.
- **SPA: `body[data-role]` CSS gate.** Every admin-only DOM node carries `data-admin-only`; a single CSS rule hides them when `state.role === 'guest'`. Sidebar nav (Backfill/Stories/Account add), Settings sections (everything except Video Player + Appearance), gallery delete buttons, queue mutation buttons — all gone for guests in one pass.
- **SPA router** redirects guest sessions away from `#/groups`, `#/backfill`, `#/queue`, `#/engine`, `#/stories`, `#/account/add`, and any `#/settings/<section>` other than `video-player` / `appearance` to `#/viewer`.
- **Header role pill** ("Guest") so the user always knows which role is active.
- **`api.js` 403 interceptor** toasts `errors.admin_only` for the rare race where a stale guest tab fires an admin call.

### Added — Recent backfills: per-row delete + Clear all
The Recent backfills list (last 30 days) was display-only; long lists could not be tidied up.

- **`DELETE /api/history/:jobId`** — drops one finished entry from the in-memory map + on-disk `history-jobs.json`. Refuses to delete a running job (cancel first).
- **`DELETE /api/history`** — clear every finished entry in one call. Running jobs are preserved.
- **Per-row × button** + **Clear all** on Backfill → Recent. Cross-tab via WS `history_deleted` / `history_cleared` so other open tabs drop the row in real time.

### Added — Checksum-based duplicate finder (Maintenance)
The `downloads.file_hash` column has been in the schema since v2 but was never populated. Maintenance now exposes a one-shot scan that hashes every file, groups byte-identical copies, and lets the admin pick which to keep.

- **New `src/core/dedup.js`** — `findDuplicates()` walks every row missing `file_hash`, streams SHA-256 over the file, writes the digest back, then GROUPs BY hash for sets where COUNT > 1. First scan is O(bytes-on-disk); subsequent scans are nearly free.
- **`POST /api/maintenance/dedup/scan`** — runs the catch-up + grouping. Broadcasts `dedup_progress` over WS for a determinate progress bar. Single in-flight guard: a second concurrent scan returns 409.
- **`POST /api/maintenance/dedup/delete`** — body `{ ids: [...] }`. Deletes the selected files from disk AND drops their DB rows in one transactional sweep. Reports `{ removed, freedBytes, missingFiles }`.
- **Maintenance UI** — new **Find duplicate files** button. Scans, then opens a sheet with every duplicate set: thumbnails, filenames, group, date, file URL preview link. Default selection deletes all but the **oldest** copy in each set; per-set **Keep oldest / Keep newest** shortcuts; per-row checkbox flips. Bottom of the sheet shows live "N selected · X MB will be freed" totals + an explicit destructive confirm before deletion.

### Changed — Mobile gallery: smooth + working video previews

- **`FILES_PER_PAGE` is now viewport-aware** — desktop stays at 100; mobile (`max-width: 768px`) drops to 50, matching the lower tile-per-row count so DOM size scales with screen size.
- **Mobile video tiles use a poster-only render** — `<video preload="none">` is unreliable on mobile Safari (often paints a blank black tile) and high-memory across a 50-tile grid even when it works. Mobile now renders an icon + play badge inside a subtle gradient instead. Tap still opens the full viewer with the real `<video>`. Desktop keeps the existing lazy `<video>` for hover scrub.
- `<img>` tiles gained `loading="lazy"` to avoid an iOS over-eager prefetch when the user scrolls fast.

### Tests
- 8 new tests in `tests/web-auth.test.js` covering the role-aware `loginVerify`, `isGuestEnabled`, `issueSession({ role })`, and `revokeAllGuestSessions`.

### SW
- VERSION bumped `'v25'` → `'v26'`.

## [2.3.25] — 2026-04-28

### Changed — backpressure abort window 5 min → 15 min
The history-backfill backpressure was aborting jobs whose pending queue sat just barely above the cap (e.g. 513 vs 500), even when the downloader was healthy.

Why it fired: a single bad-luck job that hits FloodWait every retry can stall for `MAX_FLOOD_RETRIES × delay` = 8 × 60 s = **8 min** before the downloader gives up and emits an `error` event. The backfill abort at 5 min therefore guaranteed a kill in this scenario, even though the downloader was healthy and would have recovered.

- **Default `backpressureMaxWaitMs`** bumped 5 min → **15 min** in both `history.js` (inline fallback) + `settings.js` (Advanced default) + `server.js` (config validator default). Existing user configs that have an explicit value keep theirs unchanged.
- **New `stalled` event** emitted by the history runner at the half-way mark (7.5 min by default). Carries `{ pending, cap, stallSeconds }`. The runtime forwards it for the SPA to render a "stalled, still trying…" hint without dropping the job.

### SW
- VERSION bumped `'v24'` → `'v25'`.

## [2.3.24] — 2026-04-28

### Changed — gallery feels smooth
- **Pre-fetch the next page from 1200 px away.** The IntersectionObserver on `#load-more-sentinel` now uses `rootMargin: '1200px 0px 1200px 0px'`, so the next batch is requested while the user is still ~1200 px from the bottom of the current one. Combined with the bigger page size below, the visible scroll-stutter on a long gallery should be gone.
- **`FILES_PER_PAGE: 50 → 100`.** Half the round trips for the same scroll distance.

### Changed — `/api/monitor/status` and `/api/stats` now WS-push
The 30 s + 60 s safety polls in `monitor-status.js` and `statusbar.js` are replaced with WebSocket broadcasts:

- **Server**: `_pushMonitorStatus()` broadcasts `monitor_status_push` every 3 s with the full `/api/monitor/status` snapshot. `_pushStats()` broadcasts `stats_push` every 30 s with the full `/api/stats` payload. Both skip the build entirely when no WebSocket clients are connected, and coalesce overlapping async builds via an in-flight flag. The single GET endpoints stay on for the SPA's first paint + a manual refresh.
- **SPA `monitor-status.js`**: dropped the 30 s `setInterval`, the visibilitychange-driven catch-up, and the timer machinery. One HTTP fetch on the first subscriber so the bar isn't blank for 3 s, then rides the WS push for the rest of the session. Re-fetches once on every WS reconnect (`__ws_open`) to fill the gap a disconnect window left.
- **SPA `statusbar.js`**: dropped the 60 s stats poll. Listens for `stats_push` and applies the payload directly. Mutation events (`download_complete` / `file_deleted` / `bulk_delete` / `purge_all` / `group_purged`) still trigger an immediate refetch so the user sees their own delete / new download instantly, ahead of the next 30-second push.

Net effect: on an idle dashboard with WS connected, server-side load + client-side wakeups for these two endpoints drop from ~3 calls/min to **0**.

### SW
- VERSION bumped `'v23'` → `'v24'`.

## [2.3.23] — 2026-04-28

### Fixed — hotfix for v2.3.22 regression
- **Infinite recursion → "Maximum call stack size exceeded"** the moment the user clicked any sidebar nav. v2.3.22 added `navigateTo('viewer')` inside `showAllMedia()` to fix the "click does nothing on Settings page" bug. But `renderPage('viewer')` was *already* the caller of `showAllMedia()`, so the chain became: sidebar click → `showAllMedia` → `navigateTo` → `renderPage('viewer')` → `showAllMedia` → `navigateTo` → … → stack overflow → crash loop in the SPA. Guarded the navigation with `if (state.currentPage !== 'viewer') { navigateTo('viewer'); return; }` so renderPage re-enters the function exactly once with the page already visible, and never fires the loop.

### Changed
- **SW VERSION** bumped `'v22'` → `'v23'`.

## [2.3.22] — 2026-04-28

### Fixed
- **Clicking "All Media" did nothing visible** when the user was on Settings / Engine / Queue / Backfill. `showAllMedia()` reset state and started the fetch but never called `navigateTo('viewer')`, so the response loaded into a hidden DOM and the user saw no change. `openGroup()` already navigates correctly; brought `showAllMedia()` in line.
- **Header avatar lingered on the previous group's photo** after switching to All Media. `updateHeaderAvatar()` now treats `groupId == null` as "non-group view" and renders a generic gallery glyph instead of leaving the previous chat's avatar floating in the header. `showAllMedia()` calls `updateHeaderAvatar(null, null)` so the swap happens the moment you click.

### Changed
- **SW VERSION** bumped `'v21'` → `'v22'`.

## [2.3.21] — 2026-04-28

### Fixed
- **Queue page extremely laggy + 404 spam in console.** Two related causes:
  - Video rows rendered `<video preload="metadata" src="/files/…">` for every visible done item; Chromium pulls ~256 KB of MP4 header per row on every render, re-fired on every scroll → smoking-hot CPU + network and the "queue โครตหน่วง" report.
  - Image rows rendered `<img src="/files/…">` even for files that had been rotated / deleted / never fully written → 404 console spam.
  - **Fix**: dropped the per-row thumbnails entirely. Each row now shows a tinted icon placeholder coloured by media type (blue for image, white-on-black for video, orange for audio, grey for everything else). Click-to-view still opens the actual file in the in-app viewer when the row is `done`. Zero network round-trips, zero 404 risk.

### Added
- **Max Download Speed: free-form input.** The hard-coded 5-option dropdown (Unlimited / 1 / 5 / 10 / 20 MB/s) is now a numeric input + KB/s / MB/s / GB/s unit picker. Empty value = unlimited; any number resolves to bytes on save. The label above the input mirrors the current value live.

### Changed
- **Default Volume slider** — step `5` → `1` for fine control, label + value live on one balanced row above the bar (was label-above + value-below). Picks up the branded `.tg-range` thumb so it matches the player's volume slider.

### SW
- VERSION bumped `'v20'` → `'v21'`.

## [2.3.20] — 2026-04-28

### Fixed
- **Status-bar disk usage was still nonsense after v2.3.19** ("Disk: 1.03 MB" with 8 786 files) because the DB rows themselves carried `file_size = 0 / NULL` from older downloader versions that didn't always stat after rename. The integrity sweep now **backfills the correct on-disk size** every time it walks a row whose stored `file_size` doesn't match the actual `fs.stat().size`. Result: after one boot-sweep pass (≈30 s after start, then every `intervalMin` minutes), the status-bar disk number reflects reality. The sweep also now tolerates the legacy `data/downloads/` prefix in `file_path` (same fix v2.3.19 applied to `safeResolveDownload()`), so rows that were previously skipped as "outside downloads dir" will now stat + heal cleanly.
- **Manual `Verify files on disk`** in Settings → Maintenance now reports `sizeFixed` alongside `pruned`, so you can see how many DB rows had their byte-count repaired.

### Changed
- **SW VERSION** bumped `'v19'` → `'v20'`.

## [2.3.19] — 2026-04-28

### Fixed
- **Queue thumbnail / "click to view" 404'd for every finished item.** Root cause: `downloader.js`'s `buildPath()` defaults to `'./data/downloads'` (relative), so `writtenPath` (and the `complete` event payload's `filePath`) is a relative string like `data/downloads/<group>/images/<file>`. v2.3.6's stripper only handled the absolute form (`/app/data/downloads/<…>`); when the input was relative-with-prefix it slipped through unchanged → SPA built `/files/data/downloads/<…>` → `safeResolveDownload()` joined to `DOWNLOADS_DIR` a second time → 404. Two-part fix:
  - `pushQueueHistory()` now walks **three** forms (absolute under `DOWNLOADS_DIR` / relative `./data/downloads/` / relative `data/downloads/`) and strips whichever it sees, so new entries persist the canonical `<group>/<type>/<file>` form.
  - `safeResolveDownload()` is now **lenient on the legacy prefix** — it strips any leading `data/downloads/` (and `data\downloads\` on Windows) before joining to `DOWNLOADS_DIR`, so existing queue-history entries + DB rows from before this release also resolve correctly.
- **All Media: some tiles 404 / "click open viewer" failed for some files.** Same root cause — DB rows from before the path-stripping fix carried the legacy prefix. The `safeResolveDownload()` change above fixes those too without a DB rewrite.
- **Status-bar disk usage showed nonsensical values** (e.g. `930.54 KB` with 8 784 files). The endpoint was reading from `data/disk_usage.json` — a cache that older downloader versions wrote sparingly and never invalidated when the DB was purged + repopulated. Switched to the live `SUM(file_size)` from the DB (`getDbStats().totalSize`); falls back to the JSON cache only when the DB sum is zero.

### Changed
- **SW VERSION** bumped `'v18'` → `'v19'`.

## [2.3.18] — 2026-04-28

### Added — `?v=` cache-busting on JS / locale assets
- **HTML rewrite**: `<script src="/js/...">`, `<link href="/locales/...">`, etc., are post-processed before the SPA HTML is served, appending `?v=<APP_VERSION>` to every internal `js/` or `locales/` URL.
- **JS rewrite**: every relative `import './X.js'` (and `import('./X.js')`, `import './X.js'`) inside the served JS modules is rewritten to carry the same `?v=` so the child URL inherits the cache-bust and the browser HTTP cache can't stale-serve a single transitive module while the rest of the bundle is fresh.
- **Cache-Control upgrade**: any `/js/*.js` or `/locales/*.json` request that arrives with a `?v=` query string now returns `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable`. Bare requests (no `?v=`) keep the conservative 1 h fallback so a curl / direct fetch still revalidates.
- **In-memory rewrite cache** so the regex runs once per file per process lifetime; a server restart re-reads (which is exactly what we want after `docker compose pull`).

The combined effect: a fresh release flips every internal asset URL automatically (no manual filename hashing, no build step), the browser HTTP cache treats it as a different resource, and the SW cache-first path naturally fetches the new bytes too.

### Changed
- **SW VERSION** bumped `'v17'` → `'v18'`.

## [2.3.17] — 2026-04-28

### Removed
- **Help paragraph under the Font picker.** The text was stuck at "All ten options support Thai" since v2.3.14, never updated when v2.3.15 added the 10 Latin-only fonts (and would have grown stale again next time the registry expands). Removed entirely — the picker is self-explanatory because the `<optgroup>` labels already say "Thai-capable", "Latin (Thai falls back)", and "No webfont".
- Dropped i18n keys `settings.font_help` (en + th). 637 → **636 keys total** (parity preserved).

### Changed
- **SW VERSION** bumped `'v16'` → `'v17'`.

## [2.3.16] — 2026-04-28

### Fixed
- **Font picker `<select>` was rendering empty** for some users. Root cause: `app.js`'s init wired the picker through `await import('./fonts.js')` (dynamic import). When the service worker had a stale shell cached, the dynamic import either resolved to the wrong module instance or failed silently — either way `populateSelect()` never ran and the dropdown stayed empty (`<!-- Options populated by js/fonts.js… -->` comment visible only to anyone inspecting the DOM).
  - Switched to a **static `import * as Fonts from './fonts.js'`** at the top of `app.js` so the SW handles `fonts.js` like any other shell module.
  - Added a **defensive re-populate inside `loadSettings()`** so opening the Settings page always seeds the dropdown, even if init's first attempt failed. The change-listener gets wired exactly once per session via a module-level `_fontPickerWired` flag.
- **SW VERSION** bumped `'v15'` → `'v16'` so the static-import path actually reaches the browser instead of being served from the v2.3.15 cache.

## [2.3.15] — 2026-04-28

### Added — Latin font choices
- **10 Latin Google Fonts** added to the picker on top of v2.3.14's 10 Thai-capable fonts: **Roboto**, **Inter**, **Open Sans**, **Lato**, **Source Sans 3**, **Manrope**, **DM Sans**, **Work Sans**, **Plus Jakarta Sans**, **Outfit**. Thai characters fall back through the `--tgdl-font-family` chain to IBM Plex Sans Thai so a Latin-only pick (e.g. Roboto) still renders Thai cleanly.
- The `<select>` is now grouped by `<optgroup>`: **Thai-capable** (10), **Latin (Thai falls back)** (10), **No webfont** (1) = **21 total**.

### Fixed
- **Per-group view: media not complete after switching from a Photos / Videos tab.** When the user filtered All Media to Photos and then clicked a group in the sidebar, the previous `state.currentFilter` survived → `loadGroupFiles()` fetched `?type=images` only → user saw a partial library and the tab UI silently said "All". Both `openGroup()` and `showAllMedia()` now reset the filter to "all" and re-paint the tab strip to match.

### Changed
- **SW VERSION** bumped `'v14'` → `'v15'` so the new font registry + filter-reset reach the browser.

## [2.3.14] — 2026-04-28

### Added — user-selectable font
- **Settings → Appearance → Font** — pick from 11 options (10 Google Fonts that support Thai + a no-webfont "System default"). IBM Plex Sans is still the default. Switching applies live across the whole app via a `--tgdl-font-family` CSS variable; mono regions (time block, log viewer, queue size column) stay on IBM Plex Mono regardless of UI choice.
  - **IBM Plex Sans** (default, current pair: IBM Plex Sans + IBM Plex Sans Thai)
  - **Noto Sans Thai** (Google's own pan-script family)
  - **Sarabun** (very common Thai government / SaaS font)
  - **Prompt** (modern Thai display)
  - **Kanit** (popular UI face)
  - **Mitr** (rounded, friendly)
  - **K2D** (geometric, pairs well with Latin)
  - **Bai Jamjuree** (geometric)
  - **Athiti** (humanist sans)
  - **Niramit** (light / airy)
  - **System default** (no webfont — uses the OS's native Thai face; useful for air-gapped deployments)
- **Boot-time font preload** in `index.html` reads the saved choice from `localStorage` BEFORE first paint and injects the matching `<link>` so the SPA opens with the right font already in CSSOM (no flash of unstyled text on cold load).
- New module `js/fonts.js` houses the font registry + `applyFont()` + `populateSelect()`. The boot-time `<script>` mirrors the same registry inline (the script runs before the module graph evaluates).
- **i18n**: `settings.font`, `settings.font_help` (en + th lockstep, 637 keys total).

### Changed
- **SW VERSION** bumped `'v13'` → `'v14'` so the new `index.html` (with boot script + font select) reaches the browser instead of being served from the v2.3.13 cache.

## [2.3.13] — 2026-04-28

### Changed — locale tone + casing pass

- **`th.json` rewritten in formal-but-readable Thai** — the tone a Thai-language SaaS product (Notion Thai, Microsoft Thai) would ship. Removed casual particles, used polite constructions, replaced slangy translations ("เซฟ" → "บันทึก", "หน้าตา" → "รูปลักษณ์", "หลุดจาก server เลย" → "ขาดการเชื่อมต่อกับเซิร์ฟเวอร์"). No trailing periods on Thai sentences (Thai punctuation convention). Tech terms kept in English where Thai devs say them that way (`monitor`, `queue`, `session`, `proxy`, `gramJS`, `MTProxy`, `WebSocket`, `dashboard`, `container`, `Stories`, `release notes`, `PiP`, `fullscreen`, `Backfill`, `Rescue`).
- **`en.json` recapped to proper English casing**:
  - **Buttons / form labels / nav items / tab names** → Title Case (`Save Credentials`, `Add Account`, `Browse Chats`, `Run Again`, `Restart Monitor`, `Telegram API`).
  - **Help text / descriptions / toasts / confirmations** → sentence case with terminal periods.
  - **Acronyms** always ALL CAPS: PiP, HTTPS, JSON, SQLite, OTP, FloodWait, MTProxy, NTP, WAL, etc.
  - **Tech proper nouns** kept verbatim: Telegram, GitHub, Docker, Express, gramJS, IBM, GHCR.
- All 635 keys preserved (parity 635 / 635); every `{placeholder}` token, `_html` markup, code span, and URL untouched.
- **SW VERSION** bumped `'v12'` → `'v13'` so the recapped strings actually reach the browser instead of being served from the previous cache.

## [2.3.12] — 2026-04-28

### Added
- **Settings → Video Player** now covers every realistic playback preference. New options on top of v2.3.9's autoplay/start-muted/loop/auto-advance/resume/default-speed/default-volume:
  - **Show Picture-in-Picture button** (toggle) — hide if you never use PiP, frees toolbar space.
  - **Show speed button** (toggle) — same idea; default speed is still configurable below.
  - **Double-tap to fullscreen** (toggle) — defaults ON to match legacy behaviour.
  - **Skip step (s)** (number, 1–60, default 5) — controls how far ← / → arrow keys jump. Shift-arrow now jumps `step × 2` for power users.
  - **Hide controls after (s)** (number, 1–30, default 3) — auto-hide delay for the player toolbar.

### Changed
- **Sidebar "Viewer" entry removed** — was a third redundant entry-point to the same `#/viewer` page (the "All Media" card right below + the bottom-nav "Library" item already cover it). Cleaner sidebar; no functional change.
- **Update-check cache TTL: 1 h → 10 min** to shorten the window between a release going live and the dashboard showing the update pill. Cache is shared across all clients of one instance, so 6 upstream calls per hour total is comfortably under GitHub's 60-req-per-hour-per-IP unauthenticated rate limit.
- **Service-worker cache** bumped `'v11'` → `'v12'` to flush the older cached JS for users upgrading through this release.

### i18n
- 18 new keys (10 settings labels/help + 8 toast confirmations), en + th lockstep, 635 keys total.

## [2.3.11] — 2026-04-28

### Fixed
- **Service-worker cache was holding stale `settings.js` + `index.html` for users who pulled v2.3.5–v2.3.10.** SW `VERSION` was last bumped to `'v3'` in v2.3.4 and never since (despite the comment "Going forward, this string bumps with every meaningful release" — sorry). Result: a user pulled v2.3.7 → v2.3.10, the new HTML loaded fine (network-first for navigation), but `/js/settings.js` stayed cached (cache-first for static assets) so the new Video Player toggles rendered with no behaviour wired. Bumped to `'v11'`; the activate handler purges every non-matching cache key on first hit, so the upgrade is one reload.
- **Update-check cache was 6 hours.** That window meant a fresh release could be live for hours before the dashboard's update pill appeared. TTL lowered to **1 hour**; additionally the cache is **bypassed when the running container is at-or-newer than the cached `latest`** (means we just rolled forward and a release was probably published in the window — re-fetch instead of trusting the stale "no update" answer).

### Added
- **IBM Plex Sans + IBM Plex Mono + IBM Plex Sans Thai** as the primary UI / mono / Thai fonts. Thai users get a font that ships proper Thai letterforms instead of falling back to the system; mono digits in the time block / queue size column / log viewer become consistent across browsers. Roboto kept in the fallback stack so an offline session that already cached it still renders cleanly.

### Changed
- **Branded range-slider** styling now covers every range input (player volume, Settings → Video Player default volume, plus a `.tg-range` class for future inputs). 14 × 14 white thumb with brand-blue ring on a 4 px track in both Webkit + Firefox. Settings → Video Player volume slider now matches the player's exactly instead of rendering the UA default.

## [2.3.10] — 2026-04-28

### Fixed
- **Video player controls layout was jittery + the volume slider clashed with the time text.** The volume slider used a `w-0 → group-hover:w-20` collapse trick that pushed every control to its right (including the `00:00 / 00:00` time block) sideways every time the cursor crossed the mute button. Worse, hover-only meant touch users couldn't reach it at all.
  - Volume slider is now **always visible at 80 px on `sm:` and up** (hidden on phones — system volume buttons + the mute toggle cover that case better).
  - Each child of the controls row has a **fixed footprint** (play `40 × 40`, mute `36 × 36`, volume `80 × 4`, speed/PiP/FS `36 × 36` each); the time block is mono-font with `tabular-nums` so digits don't reflow as the clip plays.
  - Right cluster (speed / PiP / fullscreen) is pinned to the right via a `flex-1` spacer instead of `justify-between` on the parent — separates layout intent from the inner spacing so a future toolbar item can slot in cleanly.
  - **Polished volume thumb**: 12 × 12 white circle with brand-blue ring, custom track height 4 px on both Webkit and Firefox. Default UA thumb was comically large on Chromium and barely visible on Firefox.
  - Speed button reads `1×` (multiplication sign) instead of `1x` (lowercase x) — matches the dropdown labels in Settings → Video Player.

## [2.3.9] — 2026-04-28

### Added
- **Settings → Video Player** — dedicated section for every playback preference. All settings are browser-side (`localStorage`), no server round-trip; the viewer module reads the same keys on every clip `.load()` so changes take effect on the next open.
  - **Autoplay videos** — start playing automatically on open. Falls back to a muted start if the browser blocks autoplay-with-sound.
  - **Start muted** — toggles the saved mute state explicitly (also satisfies most browsers' autoplay policy).
  - **Loop video** — `<video loop>` flag, restarts the clip at the end.
  - **Auto-advance to next** — when a video ends and looping is off, opens the next file in the gallery automatically (60 ms debounce so the previous `onended` returns first).
  - **Remember position** — toggle to disable the existing per-clip resume behaviour. Defaults to ON to preserve legacy behaviour; the saved per-clip key is preserved when off so re-enabling restores everyone's history.
  - **Default playback speed** — bound directly to the existing `video-speed` localStorage key, so changing it propagates to every player open instantly.
  - **Default volume** — same pattern, bound to `video-volume` (0–100% slider with live label).
- **i18n**: 12 new keys for the settings labels + helper text + toast confirmations (en + th lockstep, 621 keys total).

## [2.3.8] — 2026-04-28

### Fixed
- **Backfill page "Recent backfills" was showing the same chat several times** when the user re-ran a job (e.g., a Failed run + a manual retry produced two visible rows). Recent list is now deduped by `(groupId, limit)` — the **newest attempt** is shown, with a small `× N attempts` badge surfacing how many earlier runs were folded in. Different limits for the same chat (`Last 100` vs `All`) stay as separate rows because they're genuinely different actions. Underlying `data/history-jobs.json` still records every attempt for audit; only the UI list collapses.
- **i18n**: `backfill.row.attempts`, `backfill.row.attempts_help` (en + th lockstep, 598 keys).

## [2.3.7] — 2026-04-28

### Fixed
- **History backpressure abort** ("History backpressure timed out (5min) — downloader appears stuck") now only fires when the downloader genuinely makes **zero forward progress** during the wait window. The previous logic counted from when the queue first hit the cap and aborted at +5 min regardless of how many downloads completed in that window — a slow large clip, a heavy FloodWait throttle, or any sustained-but-progressing run could trip it. The new check subscribes to the downloader's `complete` event AND watches `pendingCount` for a decrease; either resets the no-progress timer. The abort message now includes the actual pending count + cap so it's clear whether the cause is a stalled worker (FloodWait, network) or a misconfigured cap. Combined with the v2.3.6 FloodWait infinite-retry fix, the spurious 5-min abort should be gone in practice.

## [2.3.6] — 2026-04-28

A blocker fix in the gallery (libraries with thousands of files were capped at ~209 visible), plus the priority items from a third audit pass — silent FloodWait loops, Windows-reserved filenames, downloader/rotator races, queue UX overhaul, and the avatar flicker.

### Fixed — blocker
- **All Media was capped at ~400 files.** `loadAllFiles()` was hard-coded to fetch the first 20 groups × 20 files each, with no pagination and no infinite-scroll. A library with 2454 files would render only ~209 in the gallery (and Photos / Videos tabs ~30–50 each). New endpoint `GET /api/downloads/all?page&limit&type` orders by `created_at DESC` across every group, the SPA's existing `setupInfiniteScroll` sentinel pages it, and the per-tab type filter is now a server-side `?type=` query so the count under each tab is accurate. Also fixed an off-by-one where a perfectly-packed last page kept pagination armed forever.

### Fixed — critical
- **FloodWait retry was a tight infinite loop.** `downloader.js:717` called `return this.download(job, attempt)` *without* incrementing `attempt`, so a sustained throttle would re-enter forever. Now tracks FloodWait retries on a separate counter (`MAX_FLOOD_RETRIES = 8`); the normal retry budget stays untouched but a persistent flood gives up cleanly.
- **`sanitizeName()` produced filenames Windows refuses to open.** A chat literally named `CON`, `PRN`, `AUX`, `NUL`, `COM1`–`COM9`, or `LPT1`–`LPT9` (with or without an extension) would land in a folder Windows can't even `stat`. Reserved-name check now prefixes with `_`. Also switched the truncation from `slice(0, 80)` (UTF-16 char count → mid-codepoint cut on multibyte chars) to UTF-8 byte truncation that backs off to the last full codepoint.
- **Rename collision silently overwrote.** `fs.rename(.part, final)` is destructive on every major platform — two accounts that produced the same final filename would see one's content quietly replace the other's, with the earlier DB row pointing at the wrong bytes. Now suffixes ` (1)`, ` (2)` … on collision.
- **Disk-rotator could delete a file the downloader was mid-writing.** Caused intermittent `Downloaded file is empty (0 bytes)` failures in the wild because the rotator's sweep would unlink the `.part` out from under the active download. Downloader now publishes `_activeFilePaths: Set<string>`; the rotator's constructor takes a `getActiveFilePaths` accessor and skips any candidate whose absolute path is in the Set.
- **gramJS keep-alive kept hammering throttled DCs.** The `Api.PingDelayDisconnect` catch was logging FloodWait but pinging again 60 s later. Now serves a 10-minute backoff per offending account before the next ping; warn lines are still coalesced to one per 5 min.

### Fixed — UX
- **Avatar flicker on every sidebar re-render.** `/api/groups/:id/photo` was inheriting the global `/api/*` `Cache-Control: no-store` policy, so every `renderGroupsList()` paint forced a fresh round-trip and a brief flash. The endpoint now overrides with `private, max-age=86400, stale-while-revalidate=604800` — bytes are content-addressed by group ID and rewritten in place when the photo changes, so the long TTL is safe.
- **Queue page overhaul.**
  - Finished rows are clickable and open the matching media in the in-app viewer (image / video / audio).
  - Cancel + dismiss now go through the themed `confirmSheet` (was instant, easy to mis-tap).
  - Progress bar reads 100 % when status is `done` (was stuck at 0 %); shows blank for queued (was 0 %).
  - Size column shows `…` for queued items whose size hasn't been negotiated yet, `—` only when truly unknown.
  - Real thumbnail (image / video poster) for finished rows where we know the file path; the icon stays as fallback.
- **Forwarder delete-after-forward unlink failure** is now logged at WARN with the filename instead of swallowed inside the upload catch — the integrity sweep will eventually reap the orphan.

### Fixed — DB performance
- **`busy_timeout = 5000`** added at boot. A long write (rescue / disk-rotator bulk delete) used to fail concurrent reads instantly with `SQLITE_BUSY`; now waits up to 5 s.
- **`wal_autocheckpoint = 1000`** explicit. Tames `-wal` growth on sustained writes.
- **Hot-path prepared-statement cache.** `isDownloaded()` and `fileAlreadyStored()` were re-preparing the same SQL on every call (called per message in every monitor pass); module-level `_prep()` cache fixes that.

### Added — endpoint + i18n
- `GET /api/downloads/all` for the All Media surface.
- `queue.confirm.cancel_title`, `queue.confirm.cancel` in en + th lockstep (596 keys total).

## [2.3.5] — 2026-04-28

### Fixed
- **Telegram release notifier was sending raw Markdown.** `.github/workflows/telegram-notify.yml` was POSTing the release body to `sendMessage` with `parse_mode=HTML` after only HTML-escaping it — so `**bold**`, `### headers`, and `` `code` `` shipped as literal characters. Replaced the escape step with a tiny inline Python pass that converts the GitHub-Markdown subset we actually use (headers, bold, italic, inline code, fenced code, bullets, links, hrules) into the matching Telegram-HTML subset (`<b>`, `<i>`, `<code>`, `<pre>`, `<a>`, `•`) before sending. Code blocks and inline code stay HTML-safe; the link `[text](url)` form is preserved.

## [2.3.4] — 2026-04-28

Last items from the multi-pass audit. Closes the remaining "deferred" tasks: WS reconnect storm, sheet stacking edge case, log-read hang, stale service-worker cache.

### Fixed
- **WebSocket reconnect storm.** ws.js now caps automatic reconnects at 12 attempts (~6 minutes of capped backoff) and emits a `__ws_giveup` pseudo-event. The status bar paints the WS dot orange + shows a one-time toast and a click-to-retry handler, instead of leaving the user staring at a silent red dot with no way to recover other than refresh.
- **Sheet stacking backdrop click.** Backdrop click on a sheet that's no longer the topmost no-ops, so a stacked Sheet B's backdrop can't fall through and close the underlying Sheet A.
- **Log-read hang in Maintenance.** `fetch /api/maintenance/logs/download` now uses an AbortController with a 30 s ceiling, releases the in-flight server-side stream on abort, and surfaces a clear "log read timed out" message instead of leaving the View button disabled forever.
- **Service-worker cache stuck on `v1`.** The static `VERSION = 'v1'` meant deploys never invalidated the shell + asset caches automatically. Bumped to `v3`; the `activate` handler will purge the old `tgdl-shell-v1` / `tgdl-assets-v1` caches on first hit. (Going forward, this string bumps with every meaningful release.)
- **i18n keys.** `ws.giveup`, `ws.giveup_retry`, `maintenance.logs.timeout` in en + th lockstep (594 keys total).

## [2.3.3] — 2026-04-28

Second-pass audit plus four additional defects surfaced in production. Fixes a real entity-cache shape bug and a path-traversal hole in the profile-photo endpoint that the first audit missed.

### Fixed — security
- **Path traversal in `/api/groups/:id/photo`** — `req.params.id` was interpolated straight into a filesystem path with no validation. A request like `/api/groups/..%2F..%2Fetc%2Fpasswd/photo` could escape `PHOTOS_DIR`. Now requires `id` to match `/^-?\d+$/` (signed Telegram ID) and runs a `fs.realpathSync` check before `sendFile`.
- **CSRF defence-in-depth.** Added an Origin / Referer same-host check to every `POST` / `PUT` / `PATCH` / `DELETE`. Requests with neither header (CLI, native clients) pass through — the `sameSite=strict` cookie still gates them.
- **Prototype-pollution filter** on the `POST /api/config` body. Strips `__proto__`, `constructor`, `prototype` keys recursively before any `{ ...currentConfig, ...req.body }` spread.

### Fixed — backend correctness
- **`entityCache` shape bug.** First lookup returned `{ entity, client }`, but the cache stored only `entity`. Every subsequent cache hit returned a bare entity, so callers reading `r.entity` got `undefined` and silently fell through to "unknown chat" naming. Cache now stores `{ entity, client, at }`, has a 30-min TTL, and a 5000-entry hard cap so it can't grow without bound.
- **`saveConfig()` was not atomic.** `fs.writeFileSync(CONFIG_PATH, json)` could be observed mid-write by `fs.watch` consumers (monitor.js's `reloadConfig`), making `JSON.parse` throw on a half-written file. Switched to temp-file + `fs.renameSync()` (atomic on POSIX + NTFS).
- **Standalone-downloader IIFEs** in `/api/stories/download` and `/api/download/url` had no error boundary — a throw inside the drain loop became an unhandled rejection. Wrapped in `.catch()`.
- **`/api/dialogs` cache TTL** could become permanent if the system clock jumped backward (NTP correction). Wrapped the `now - cache.at` comparisons in `Math.max(0, …)`.
- **EADDRINUSE on `server.listen()`** failed silently — the container exited with no clue where to look. Added an `error` handler that prints a clear "Port X is already in use" message and `process.exit(1)`.

### Fixed — frontend
- **VideoPlayer seek bar + play/pause didn't reset between clips** — switching clips from the gallery left the progress bar mid-track and the play icon showing the previous clip's state, because a stale `ontimeupdate` from the OLD source could fire after `load()` reset the UI but before the new src had taken over. Now explicitly `pause()` + `currentTime = 0` + null `onloadedmetadata` BEFORE the UI reset.
- **Backfill `startElapsedTimer()` defensive guard** — clears any existing interval before re-arming so a router double-fire on `#/backfill` can't stack two tickers.

## [2.3.2] — 2026-04-28

Audit-driven defect sweep — fixes uncovered while reviewing v2.3.1 in detail. No new feature surface; everything below is correctness, leak-prevention, or UX polish.

### Fixed — frontend
- **VideoPlayer fullscreen listener leak.** Every viewer open used to attach a fresh `fullscreenchange` listener on `document` without removing the previous one. After 100 opens, 100 stale callbacks fired on every F11. Listener ref is now stored on the player instance and detached in `unload()` / `destroy()`.
- **VideoPlayer resume race.** `onloadedmetadata` from a previous clip could fire after a new clip had loaded and seek the new file to the wrong timestamp. The handler is now nulled in `unload()` so a stale resume can't bleed across clips.
- **Backfill page elapsed-time ticker leak.** `setInterval` fired every 1 s for the rest of the tab's life even after navigating away from `#/backfill`. Router now calls `stopBackfillPage()` on route change.
- **Status-bar double-bound on hot reload.** `initStatusBar()` had no idempotence guard, so a stray double call (recovery flow, dev hot-reload) bound every WS handler twice and fired each event 2×. Added `_booted` guard.
- **Update-pill dismiss double-fire.** Rapid clicks on the new update notifier's × could fire the dismiss handler twice before the badge hid. Added per-paint `dismissing` guard.
- **i18n early-bootstrap race.** Modules that translated during bootstrap (before `initI18n()` resolved) saw an empty dict. Added a `ready` promise consumers can `await`.
- **Gallery section headers were `position: sticky`** inside a CSS Grid, which clipped trailing tiles and stacked multiple "Today / Yesterday / …" headers at the top of the scrollport while scrolling. Reverted to inline static headers.
- **`setting-max-disk` dropdown was non-functional** — the `<input list>` datalist autocomplete didn't render a clickable arrow on most browsers / mobile. Replaced with a real numeric input + unit `<select>` (MB / GB / TB). Legacy free-form values like "500GB", "1.5 TB", "250 MB" still parse correctly on load.
- **Light-mode dim text** — labels like "Downloaded Groups" in the sidebar were rendered in `#65737E` on a `#F4F4F5` background, which barely passed contrast and needed hover to read. Bumped `.text-tg-textSecondary` to `#4B5563` (Tailwind gray-600) in light mode for headers and footer captions.
- **Borderless inputs in both themes** — `.tg-input` was declared `border: none` in dark mode and only `<input>` (not `<select>`) got a light-mode border, so dropdowns blended into their card background. Added a subtle 1 px border in dark mode (`#38444D`, hovers to `#4A5C6E`, focuses to the brand blue) and broadened the light-mode rule to cover both inputs and selects.
- **`.tg-btn-secondary` had no base CSS in dark mode** — the class was used on dozens of buttons (Save credentials, Export, Resync, Restart, log View/Copy/Download, Backfill presets, Remove account, …) but only had a light-mode override. Dark-mode buttons fell back to the browser default and looked broken. Added a proper base style (panel-grey background, subtle border, hover + active + disabled states) and tightened the light-mode override to match.

### Fixed — backend
- **Schema migrations now smoke-tested at boot.** The `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN` migrations were wrapped in `try/catch` to ignore "column already exists", which also swallowed real failures (out-of-disk, locked DB, corrupt schema). A `SELECT pinned, pending_until, rescued_at, ttl_seconds, file_hash FROM downloads LIMIT 0` after the migration block forces "no such column" failures to surface at boot instead of mid-download.
- **Graceful shutdown** on `SIGTERM` / `SIGINT`. Stops the integrity sweep, rescue sweeper, disk rotator, monitor, and keep-alive ping; closes every WebSocket with code 1001; drains the HTTP server. Hard-exit safety net at 5 s. Makes `docker compose restart` snappy and stops phantom WS reconnect attempts during the bounce.
- **`/api/maintenance/logs/download` realpath check.** Basename filter alone could be tricked by a symlinked log entry on case-insensitive FS; now both sides are resolved with `fs.realpathSync` and compared against `LOGS_DIR`.
- **`/api/maintenance/resync-dialogs` batched in a single transaction** instead of N `UPDATE` statements between every async `resolveEntityAcrossAccounts` call. Avoids WAL contention with concurrent gallery readers.
- **Keep-alive FloodWait surfaced.** The `Api.PingDelayDisconnect` catch was silent — a throttled DC kept getting pinged, digging the FloodWait deeper. Now logs once per account per 5-minute window when the failure is FloodWait, and clears the warn cache once a ping lands cleanly.
- **Monitor delete-event errors logged.** `handleDeleteEvent` failures (DB locked, FloodWait, missing row) used to vanish into a silent catch — the rescue panel never learned why a "rescued" badge didn't appear. Now warns to the console.

### Added — i18n
- **7 keys that the code referenced but were absent from the locale files** (rendered as raw key strings or fallback text in the UI): `backfill.row.cancel_title`, `purge.all.title`, `purge.all.title2`, `purge.group.title`, `settings.size.total_disk_help`, `viewer.bulk.title`, `viewer.delete.title`.
- **Thai locale fully humanized.** All 591 strings rewritten in natural conversational Thai instead of stiff machine-translation tone. Tech terms (`monitor`, `queue`, `download`, `session`, `proxy`, `worker`, `dashboard`, `cookie`, `Stories`, `Backfill`, `FloodWait`, `gramJS`, `Maintenance`, `Rescue`, `VACUUM`, …) kept in English where that's how Thai users actually say them. Confirmations made direct, help text rewritten in a friendly explanatory tone, possessive `ของคุณ` spam removed, every `{placeholder}` token preserved.

## [2.3.1] — 2026-04-28

### Added
- **In-dashboard update notifier.** New `GET /api/version/check` (public) polls `api.github.com/repos/.../releases/latest`, caches the result for 6 h server-side, and degrades fail-soft (last-known-good cache served on transient errors; cold-start unreachable returns `updateAvailable:false` rather than blanking the UI). The status-bar shows a clickable **"Update available → vX.Y.Z"** pill linking to the release page when the latest tag is newer than the running version (semver-numeric compare, pre-release suffix ignored). Per-version dismiss button writes to `localStorage` so the same release is never re-nagged; a per-session toast fires once so users notice on first load even if the chip is offscreen on a narrow viewport.
- **i18n keys.** `update.available`, `update.toast`, `update.click_for_release`, `update.dismiss` (en + th lockstep).

## [2.3.0] — 2026-04-28

A large quality-of-life release. Web dashboard learns to do every CLI op, the download pipeline self-heals, and four new top-level surfaces ship.

### Added — major features
- **Queue page** (`#/queue`) — IDM-style download manager. Sortable + filterable table of every job (Active / Queued / Paused / Failed / Done) with per-row pause / resume / cancel / retry, global pause-all / resume-all / clear-finished, throttle slider (max 50 MB/s), virtualised render handles 1000+ jobs without lag. WS-driven; survives a tab reload via `data/queue-history.json`.
- **Backfill page** (`#/backfill`) — promoted from a panel-buried-in-modal to a first-class surface. Three cards: active jobs (live progress + cancel), start-a-new-backfill (group picker + preset chips 100/1k/10k/All/custom), recent jobs (last 30 days). Deep-linkable per-group via `#/backfill/<groupId>`. Cancel actually aborts the in-flight gramJS download (mid-stream throw + .part cleanup), not just dequeues.
- **Rescue Mode** — per-group option that keeps only messages deleted from Telegram source within a retention window. New DB columns `pending_until` + `rescued_at`, monitor subscribes to `UpdateDeleteChannelMessages` + `UpdateDeleteMessages` across every connected account, sweeper auto-prunes anything still on Telegram after the window. Per-group override of the global default.
- **Maintenance panel** (Settings) — CLI-free ops surface: resync Telegram dialogs, restart monitor, DB integrity check + VACUUM, view + download log files in-browser, view raw `config.json` as a collapsible JSON tree, export a Telegram session string (password-gated, blurred until reveal, auto-clears in 60 s), sign-out-everywhere, force file-integrity verify. Web-only password reset flow (token printed to `docker logs` on a fresh container).
- **PWA support** — `manifest.webmanifest` + service worker + install prompt. Add-to-home-screen on mobile, Install button on desktop Chrome/Edge. SW caches the app shell + bypasses `/api/*`, `/files/*`, `/photos/*`, `/metrics`, `/ws`, and the auth pages.
- **Auto-rotate** — disk quota sweeper. When `diskManagement.maxTotalSize` is exceeded, deletes oldest unpinned downloads first. Runs every `sweepIntervalMin` (default 10 min). Toggle in Settings → Size Limits.
- **Settings → Advanced** — 14 hot-path constants surfaced as runtime-configurable settings (downloader concurrency limits, history backpressure cap + break intervals, disk-rotator batch size, integrity sweep interval, web session TTL, …). Defaults preserve existing behaviour.

### Added — operational
- **Status-bar version chip** ("v2.3.0 · sha7") at the bottom-right, links to the matching commit on GitHub. Auto-bumps on every CI push (`docker build --build-arg GIT_SHA=…`).
- **Self-healing downloads.** `downloader.js` re-stats the final file after `fs.rename` and retries on 0-byte / missing files (NFS quirks, mid-write crash). Boot-time + hourly integrity sweep walks every `downloads` row and drops the ones whose file is gone. `/files/*` 404s also background-prune the matching DB row by exact `file_path` match.
- **Monitor auto-start on container boot** when at least one account is loaded and at least one group is enabled. Opt out via `monitor.autoStart: false`.
- **Keep-alive ping** every 60 s (`Api.PingDelayDisconnect` with 90 s extension) to stop the per-DC reconnect cascade that used to fill `network.log` to multi-MB sizes.
- **`network.log` rotation** at 5 MB per file, 2 generations kept (10 MB cap total). No log lines ever skipped — only rotated.
- **`/api/version`** (public) — `{ version, commit, builtAt }` for the status-bar chip + bug reports.
- **`/api/queue/*`** — snapshot, per-job pause/resume/cancel/retry, global pause-all/resume-all/cancel-all/clear-finished, throttle save.
- **`/api/maintenance/*`** — resync-dialogs, restart-monitor, db/integrity, db/vacuum, files/verify, logs (list + download), config/raw, session/export (password-gated), sessions/revoke-all (password-gated).
- **`/api/rescue/stats`** — pending / rescued / cleared counters for the Settings panel.

### Added — UI/UX polish
- **Themed `confirmSheet` + `promptSheet`** primitives in `sheet.js` — every native `confirm()` / `alert()` / `window.prompt()` in the SPA replaced with focus-trapped, drag-dismissible, brand-styled dialogs.
- **Per-row settings cog** in the Downloaded Groups sidebar — one tap into Group Settings.
- **Header view-mode toggle** cycles grid → compact → list, persisted in localStorage.
- **Telegram-style chat avatar** in the page header, mirrors the sidebar's avatar+initial when entering a group.
- **Light-theme polish** across every newer panel (Queue, Backfill, Rescue, Maintenance, sheets, status bar).
- **Tg-toggle** bumped from 36×20 → 44×24 with a soft thumb shadow.
- **Total-Disk input** is a free-form text box with datalist suggestions (50GB → 10TB) instead of a 5-option dropdown.
- **In-browser log viewer** (`<pre>` with auto-scroll-to-bottom + Copy + Download fallback).
- **Collapsible JSON tree** for raw config.json with Expand/Collapse-all + Copy.
- **Session-export blur shield** — string is `blur-sm` until the user clicks Reveal; auto-clears in 60 s; manual Clear button; red-tinted warning card.

### Added — i18n
- **bilingual coverage** (English + Thai) brought from 65 keys at v2.1 → 580 keys at v2.3, every interactive surface routed through `i18nT()` / `i18nTf()` (interpolation helper). en/th key parity enforced in CI smoke + audit agents.

### Fixed — security
- **`_requirePassword` bypass**. `loginVerify` returns `{ok, upgrade?}`, NOT a bare boolean. The previous `!loginVerify(...)` check made any non-empty string a valid password on Export Session and Sign-out-everywhere — a full account-takeover vector for anyone with a session cookie. Now reads `result?.ok` like every other call site.
- **Password-gate** on Export Session + Sign-out-everywhere — even with a valid cookie, the user has to retype their dashboard password. Mitigates session-hijacker abuse.

### Fixed — correctness
- **"Unknown chat" leaking everywhere.** Server-side `bestGroupName(id, configName, dbName, dialogsName)` resolves in priority: live Telegram dialogs cache → config → DB → "Unknown chat (#id)" placeholder. SQL `MAX(group_name)` was returning the literal string "Unknown" because it sorts above most ASCII titles — CASE-filtered before MAX. Live `getDialogsNameCache()` shares the same source as the Browse-chats picker (5 min TTL, 5 min cache for full `/api/dialogs` body).
- **Filter → viewer wrong file**. Tile data-index pointed into the filtered list; viewer indexed `state.files[idx]` (unfiltered). Photos-filter + click photo #3 was opening a video. Now passes `originalIndex` + filter-aware prev/next.
- **Filtered-list-aware prev/next** in the viewer, double-tap-left/right to seek ±10 s on mobile.
- **Search-input dead handler** — was selecting `.group-item` (renamed to `.chat-row` long ago).
- **Bottom-nav Engine highlight** — tab lit up Settings instead of Engine; new `navKey` override on `renderPage`.
- **`/api/downloads/search` shadowed** by `/api/downloads/:groupId` — the catch-all route was matching first; now short-circuits on `groupId === 'search'`.
- **Browser notification dead handler** — runtime broadcast spreads inner type so the outer `monitor_event` envelope never reached subscribers; switched to `download_complete` directly.
- **Gallery ghost tiles** after auto-prune / disk-rotate / rescue-sweep — `file_deleted` WS handler now drops the matching tile + refreshes stats.
- **Atomic config writes** — every `fs.writeFile(CONFIG_PATH, …)` (9 callsites) routed through `writeConfigAtomic(config)`. Previously a crash mid-write left a corrupt config.

### Fixed — Docker / deployment
- **`Cannot find module '/app/src/web/server.js'`** at runtime — `chmod -R a+rX /app` between mkdir and chown in the Dockerfile (BuildKit on Windows hosts was laying down mode-0 layers).
- **Bind-mounted `/app/data` permissions** — entrypoint now runs as root, `chown -R node:node /app/data`, then `su-exec` drops to node before exec'ing the CMD.
- **Stale local images** — compose defaults to GHCR `:latest` with `pull_policy: always`; local dev can still build from source by uncommenting `build:`.
- **CI smoke test** verifies the built image actually runs (file perms, healthcheck within 30 s, app process running as `node` not root).

### Fixed — performance
- **Video playback lag** — `/files/*` cache bumped from 60 s → `private, max-age=2592000, immutable` (downloaded files are content-immutable). Browser stops revalidating every 64 KB range chunk through the auth + path-resolve pipeline.
- **Per-request config disk-read** — `readConfigSafe()` memoised for 2 s. During a video playback, force-https + checkAuth no longer disk-read on every range chunk.
- **Sidebar flicker** on WS bursts — cache `_lastHtml` and skip the `innerHTML` reassignment when nothing changed.
- **`/api/monitor/status` polling** consolidated behind one shared module (was duplicated 3× across modules); cadence dropped from 3 s → 30 s safety net (WS handlers cover the active updates).
- **`/api/stats`** throttled from 15 s → 60 s + WS-driven refresh on every `download_complete` / `file_deleted` / `bulk_delete` / `purge_*`.
- **Login + setup brute-force limiters** stay on regardless of the global rate-limit toggle.

### Changed
- **API rate limit toggle** — now opt-in (default off) for self-hosted private dashboards. Previous 600/min default was masking real load as 429s on chatty SPAs.
- **`force HTTPS`** is opt-in, default off.

### Removed
- Inline `confirm()` / `alert()` / `window.prompt()` calls in the SPA — every callsite now routes through the themed sheet primitive.

## [2.2.0] — 2026-04-27

### Added — observability
- **`GET /metrics`** — OpenMetrics / Prometheus 0.0.4 text format. Zero-dep collector in `src/core/metrics.js` fed by `src/core/runtime.js` events. Counters for downloads / failures / history jobs / URL + Stories pulls / login outcomes; gauges for queue depth, active downloads, workers, accounts, monitor state; histogram for download duration; standard `process_*` gauges. Endpoint registered before the auth middleware so a scrape job without a session cookie still reaches it. Optional `?token=…` gating via `TGDL_METRICS_TOKEN`.

### Fixed
- **Docker: `Cannot find module '/app/src/web/server.js'`** at runtime. Two compounding causes:
  1. **Mode-0 COPY layers.** BuildKit (Windows hosts and some gha-cache hits) was laying down `/app/src/*` and `/app/scripts/*` with mode `0` — `node` user owned the files but had no read permission, so Node returned ENOENT-shaped errors on EACCES traversal. Fixed by `chmod -R a+rX /app` between mkdir and chown in the Dockerfile.
  2. **Stale local images.** `docker compose up` reused locally-cached `telegram-media-downloader:latest` from a prior build instead of pulling fresh. The compose file now defaults to the prebuilt GHCR image (`ghcr.io/botnick/telegram-media-downloader:latest`) with `pull_policy: always` — `docker compose up -d` always grabs the current release. Local dev can still build from source by uncommenting `build:`.
- **`Telegram connection failed: ENOENT … data/config.json`** on every first boot. `connectTelegram()` blindly read `config.json` before the user had set anything up. It now returns silently when the file is missing or has no `apiId` / `apiHash`, and only logs a real error for non-ENOENT failures. The boot banner is also state-aware now: "First run? Open …" / "Open … and run `npm run auth` …" / "Sign in at …" depending on setup state. Banner reads the version from `package.json` directly so it shows the real version even when started with bare `node src/web/server.js`.

### Operational
- **CI smoke test for the Docker image.** `.github/workflows/docker.yml` now runs the freshly-built image, verifies file permissions are sane, and polls the in-container healthcheck for 30 s. A green build now means the image actually boots — not just that the Dockerfile parses.
- **Dockerfile cleanup.** Dropped `ENV TGDL_RUN=monitor` (only `runner.js` reads it; CMD runs `server.js`) and `COPY watchdog.ps1` (PowerShell script, unusable in Alpine).

## [2.1.0] — 2026-04-26

### Added — UI/UX overhaul (Telegram-grade desktop + mobile)
- **Hash router** with deep-linking (`#/viewer`, `#/groups/<id>`, `#/settings/<section>`, `#/stories`, `#/account/add`). Browser back/forward + URL share work everywhere.
- **Sheet primitive** — bottom-sheet on mobile (drag handle + swipe-to-dismiss), centered card on desktop. Drives shortcuts, destination picker, paste-link, stories, FAB action sheet. Focus trap + Esc-closes-topmost.
- **Mobile bottom navigation** (Library / Chats / Engine / Settings) replaces drawer-only switching at `< 768px`.
- **Floating action button** opens a Quick-Actions sheet (paste link, stories, add account, browse chats).
- Sidebar breakpoint moved from `lg` → `md` so 768–1023px ranges no longer get a cramped sidebar.
- **Telegram-style chat rows** for sidebar groups + dialog picker — avatar 48 px, bold name, last-activity subtitle, time-on-right, status pill, "selected chat" left bar.
- **Story-ring avatars** — animated conic-gradient ring around groups currently downloading; green status dot when monitoring; clears on `monitor_state=stopped`.
- **Gestures**: long-press in gallery enters select mode; pull-to-refresh on the viewer; swipe ←/→ between items in the modal viewer; vertical drag-down dismisses the viewer.
- **Time-grouped gallery** sections (Today / Yesterday / Earlier this week / Older) with sticky headers.
- **Skeletons** in the gallery and sidebar while data loads — no more empty/spinner pages.
- **i18n** with English + ไทย locales; Settings → Appearance → Language picker (Auto / English / ไทย); persisted in localStorage and applied without reload.
- A11y: real `aria-label` on every icon-only button (translatable), `min-h/w-[44px]` touch targets, `:focus-visible` Telegram-blue outline, `role="switch"` + Space/Enter on every `.tg-toggle`, `prefers-reduced-motion` respected for transitions and ring animation.
- Status bar hidden on mobile (where the bottom nav is the source of truth).

### Fixed
- Sidebar rows showing `Unknown · -1003666421064` with no avatar. PUT `/api/groups/:id` and `downloadProfilePhoto` now resolve via the multi-account `AccountManager` (with the legacy single-session client as a last-resort fallback). New endpoint `POST /api/groups/refresh-info` walks every config + DB-only group and back-fills the real name and cached profile photo. The SPA auto-fires it whenever it detects a placeholder name.
- CSP `script-src-attr 'none'` had been blocking the inline `onclick`/`oninput` handlers in `index.html` (toggles, range sliders, modal close). Added `script-src-attr 'unsafe-inline'` so the existing markup keeps working until the Phase 4 follow-up migrates handlers to `addEventListener`.

### Changed
- `npm start` (and the bare `node src/index.js`) now boots the dashboard directly instead of dropping into the interactive CLI menu. The legacy menu is reachable via `npm run menu` for headless / power-user workflows.
- `runner.js` / `watchdog.ps1` already default to `monitor`; this release also adds a POSIX `runner.sh` (Linux/macOS).

### Operational
- `.github/workflows/telegram-notify.yml` rewritten — fires on both `push` to `main` and `release.published`. Pre-releases get a 🧪 badge, release notes are HTML-escaped + length-trimmed for Telegram's parser.
- `release-drafter` + Conventional-Commits autolabeler land via `.github/workflows/release-drafter.yml` + `.github/release-drafter.yml`. The next release notes draft themselves from merged PRs.

## [2.0.0] — 2026-04-26

### Added — security
- Web dashboard auth refactor: scrypt-hashed passwords (per-password random salt), random session tokens persisted to `data/web-sessions.json`, `crypto.timingSafeEqual` everywhere.
- **Fail-closed by default**: a fresh install no longer falls through to "open access" if no password is set — every API call returns 503 and every page redirects to a setup wizard.
- WebSocket upgrade handshake validates the same session cookie as REST.
- `helmet`, `express.json({limit:'256kb'})`, `express-rate-limit` on `/api/login` (10 / 15-min / IP).
- Path safety on `/api/file` and `/files/*`: NUL-byte rejection, `path.normalize`, `fs.realpath` symlink check, default `Content-Disposition: attachment`.
- Per-blob random scrypt salt for AES session storage (wire format v=2, v=1 still decrypts).
- LICENSE, SECURITY.md, vulnerability disclosure policy.
- `docs/AUDIT.md` — full 166-finding audit with severity table.

### Added — web parity
- First-run password setup + change-password flow entirely from the browser; CLI is no longer required for security setup.
- 4-step web wizard for adding Telegram accounts (label → phone → OTP → 2FA).
- Account list / remove from Settings → Telegram Accounts.
- `/api/monitor/{status,start,stop}` + Settings → Engine card with live state, queue, active workers, uptime.
- History backfill from the Group settings modal (one-tap 100 / 1k / 10k).
- Dialogs picker covers archived chats and (opt-in) DMs.

### Added — features
- **Download by Link** (`POST /api/download/url`): paste any `t.me/.../<msg>`, `/c/<id>/<msg>`, `/c/<id>/<topic>/<msg>`, `tg://resolve`, or `tg://privatepost` URL and pull just that media.
- **Telegram Stories**: username + per-story selection, queued through the regular downloader.
- **TTL/self-destructing media**: monitor detects `media.ttlSeconds` and front-loads the queue so the file is captured before expiry.
- **Forum topics**: per-group filter list with whitelist mode.
- **Proxy** (SOCKS4/5 + MTProxy) wired into the GramJS client; Settings UI with TCP-reachability test.
- **Light / Dark / Auto theme** with OS-detected default, persisted in localStorage.
- **Browser notifications** opt-in for download-complete events.
- **Sticky status bar**: monitor state, queue, active workers, total files, disk usage, WS link.
- **Gallery search + multi-select + bulk delete**, including server-side `searchDownloads()`.

### Added — engine
- Dual-lane queue (`_high` realtime + `queue` history) — realtime no longer competes with backfill; spillover only displaces history.
- `core/runtime.js` singleton orchestrates monitor + downloader + forwarder in-process for the web server.
- WebSocket client (`ws.js`) with auto-reconnect and visibility-aware backoff.
- Connection manager `stop()` + monitor cleanup tracking; intervals are `unref`-ed so the process can exit cleanly.
- Backpressure max-wait in history (5 minutes) so a stuck downloader can't hang the command forever.

### Changed
- `runner.js` and `watchdog.ps1` now read `TGDL_RUN` env (default `monitor`) instead of hard-coding `history` — production supervision actually keeps a long-running process alive.
- gramJS internal noise (`TIMEOUT`, `Not connected`, `Reconnect`, etc.) is now classified instead of silently dropped: it logs to `data/logs/network.log` and only surfaces in stderr when `TGDL_DEBUG=1`.

### Fixed
- Terminal raw-mode is restored on `exit` / SIGINT / SIGTERM — no more dead shells on crash.
- Plaintext apiId no longer printed at CLI startup.
- `.gitignore` malformed line removed; `docs/` is now tracked.
- Orphan `src/index.js_fragment_setupWebAuth` deleted.

### Migration notes
- Old `config.web.password` (plaintext) is auto-rehashed to `config.web.passwordHash` on first successful web login.
- Old AES blob format (`v=1`) keeps decrypting; new writes are `v=2`.
- Existing `data/db.sqlite` is migrated forward automatically — `ttl_seconds` and `file_hash` columns are added on first start.
